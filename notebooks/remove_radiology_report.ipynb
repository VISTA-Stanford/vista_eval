We discussed  surgery versus observation and she preferred the former and  informed consent was obtained.  Please prior office/telephone notes for  additional details.    DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the  operating room and placed supine on the table with bilateral  Venodynes on her legs. Surgical briefing was performed and  general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  The abdomen was  prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion and a final  verification was performed. Local analgesia was infiltrated  prior to making each incision, the first being near the  umbilicus.  A Veress needle was introduced at the incision  while holding retraction on the anterior abdominal wall towards  the ceiling and CO2 gas was insufflated.  Once an adequate  pressure was reached, the Birnbaum needle was replaced with a 5  mm port followed by the angled scope.    The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg and left  lateral tilt. Under direct visualization we placed two 5 mm  ports in the right upper quadrant and a 10 mm port in the  epigastric region.  The gallbladder was grasped and held up  towards the patient\\'s right shoulder.  The fatty tissue and  adhesions surrounding the fundus and neck of the gallbladder  were carefully dissected away and we isolated the cystic duct  circumferentially. It was soft and nondilated and it did not  appear to contain stones.  It was clipped proximal and distal  being careful not to impinge on any other structures and it was  transected.  The cystic artery just medial to this was clipped  and transected in a similar fashion and the gallbladder  was  then removed from the liver bed using cautery. There was no   spillage of bile. The gallbladder  was placed in an Endo Catch bag and removed through the  subxiphoid port and sent to Pathology for further analysis.  The port was replaced and we inspected the liver bed and no  active bleeding was seen.  We inspected the cystic duct and the  cystic artery stump sites.  There was no leakage of bile or  blood and the clips were in adequate place without impingement  on any other structures.  We inspected the abdominal wall at  the port sites and no bleeding or hematomas were seen. The  visualized bowel, omentum, and liver appeared healthy and  normal.  We removed the ports and expelled as much CO2 gas as  Possible from the peritoneal cavity. 4-0 absorbable sutures  were used to reapproximate the skin edges at all the port sites  followed by Steri-Strips and dry sterile bandages.    The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Lap, needle and  instrument counts were all correct at the end of the case.    The patient was extubated and taken to the recovery room in  stable condition.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mrs Wolfe is a very pleasant 56-year-old, with a pertinent medical history of latent tuberculosis treated with 6 months of isoniazid approximately 30 years ago with reported residual lung scarring, who presents to establish and transfer care to the thoracic oncology division at Stanford. She has previously been treated at Delta  and is switching insurance prompting her visit to establish care today.     Her oncologic narrative is as follows:  1. Atypical chest pain summer 2014 prompting CT evaluation in 10/22/2014 revealing right upper lobe scarring/nodule. Recommended to be followed with serial CTs.  2. Repeat CT 01/22/2015 does not show any significant change, but she was recommended to undergo biopsy.  3. Biopsy 02/21/2015. Right upper lobe CT-guided biopsy demonstrated adenocarcinoma with exon 19 deletion and EGFR. Subsequent staging, including MRI of the brain is negative. PET-CT scan reveals 3 focal lesions; 1 in the right upper lobe which was biopsied, as well as a right middle lobe lesion, and then a left upper lobe suspicious lesion, as well. She does not have any extrathoracic disease.  4. CT-guided biopsy in 03/22/2015 of the left upper lobe, reveals suspicious cells. Cannot rule out carcinoma.  5. Mediastinoscopy 04/21/2015. Negative lymph nodes. She undergoes attempted resection in Fort Worth  with a partial right middle lobe resection. Ultimately, the surgeon aborts the procedure for unclear reasons at the time. The intention was to do a right middle lobe resection, right upper lobectomy, and to at a later date do a wedge on the left upper lobe suspicious lesion. Pathology on the right middle lobe partial wedge resection demonstrated a separate exon 21 EGFR mutation.  6. Two weeks following surgery, 04/28/2015, she starts Tarceva  or erlotinib 150 mg daily.  7. 05/22/2015, erlotinib dose reduced to 100 mg daily due to skin side effects.  8. 06/21/2015 surveillance chest imaging demonstrates stable disease.  9. September/09/21/2015 surveillance imaging demonstrates stable disease. No intracranial findings on MRI.     Today she is maintained on Tarceva 100 mg daily. She is doing relatively well. She works full time as a nurse. She only has some dry skin and faint rash, but she says this comes and goes. She is also somewhat fatigued, but has an overall good performance status of 0-1. A 14-point review of systems is negative except as noted in the above HPI.    PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: LTBI treated with 6 months of INH in her early 30s.    SOCIAL HISTORY: She is a lifetime never smoker. Works as nurse at Bowie  in the Family Medicine Department. No significant alcohol or other drug use. She was born in Lost Springs .    FAMILY HISTORY: Mother, a never smoker, died of lung cancer metastatic to the brain at age 59. Her uncle was a smoker and died of lung cancer at age 82.    PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She also had a cholecystectomy in addition to her 04/21/2015 attempted wedge resection.    LABORATORIES: Most recent labs per Care Everywhere and Volk, 09/09/2015, white blood cell count 4.4, hemoglobin 13.4, platelet count 202. Electrolytes: Creatinine 0.79, ALT 18, T bilirubin 0.7.    IMAGING STUDIES: 09/09/2015, MRI of the brain, no intracranial metastases.     09/06/2015, CT of the thorax: Right upper lobe 4.8 cm x 1.0 cm lesion stable. Left upper lobe 3.5 cm x 1 cm ground-glass opacity is stable in appearance. No liver or osseous lesions.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:     BP 118/80 mmHg | Pulse 78 | Temp(Src) 36.4 °C (97.6 °F) (Oral) | Resp 15 | Ht 1.568 m (5\\' 1.73\") | Wt 57 kg (125 lb 10.6 oz) | BMI 23.18 kg/m2 | SpO2 99%    ECOG performance status is zero. GENERAL: Awake, alert, not in any acute distress. SKIN: Dry skin evidence  on the upper and lower extremities with very faint petechiae associated papular rash on the hands, as well as some skin fissuring. LYMPH: No cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy. MUSCULOSKELETAL: Large and small joints of the upper and lower extremities have functionally normal range of motion. No significant erythema or joint effusions. CHEST: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1, S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. No significant large venous collaterals on the chest or upper thorax. HEENT: Oral mucosa is moist. There are occasional canker sores. No thrush. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Respirations are unlabored. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended. No palpable hepatosplenomegaly. NEURO: Speech normal. Gait normal. Nonfocal. Cranial Nerves: Strength, sensory, and cerebellar examined and normal. PSYCH: Mood and affect are normal/appropriate.    IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Ms Vincent Stucki is a very pleasant 56-year-old with a pertinent medical history of latent tuberculosis infection, status post 6 months of isoniazid completed 30 years ago, with reported residual lung scarring, who presents with multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations, including a right upper lobe exon 19 deletion, and a right middle lobe exon 21 mutation, presenting for consultation and to assume care of lung adenocarcinoma currently maintained on erlotinib with stable disease since 04/21/2015.     #1 Suspected multiple lung adenocarcinomas showing ground glass opacities on CT vs stage IV lung adenocarcinoma (contralateral lung lesion)    I reviewed her case extensively with Coggins, MD, thoracic oncology. We think it is likely that these distinct adenocarcinomas are separate, and that this does not represent stage IV non-small cell lung cancer with a contralateral lung lesion (PMID [000000]).    We are interested in seeing whether she has a germline EGFR mutation (T790M) , given her family  history and her multiple other EGFR mutations that have been tested (PMID [000000]). We will plan to review her case and thoracic tumor board next Tuesday, to discuss with our pathologists and radiologists, as well as our surgeons, quite possibly that we may be able to treat her more aggressively with curative intent, if we would be able to resect the right upper lobe lesion, but we will plan to discuss this further.     There is also some question as to whether she is deriving any benefit at all from being on her erlotinib, aside from the side effects she is experiencing. She will plan to obtain CT scans and chest x-rays that she has had done remotely. All we have are the last 2 years of scans, and Dr. Antunes will plan to liaise with her following thoracic tumor board next Tuesday.    SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS:   1. The patient will plan to drop-off CT scans and chest x-rays that she has had in the past for comparison purposes.  2. We will review her case and thoracic tumor board next week.  3. Referral to supportive dermato-oncology for recommendations regarding TKI-associated dermatopathy.    This patient was seen and discussed with Dr. Atreyu Gu, thoracic oncology. The patient and her husband had the opportunity to ask questions and they were answered to their satisfaction.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Ms Rafael Varner is a very pleasant 56-year-old with a pertinent medical history of latent tuberculosis infection, status post 6 months of isoniazid completed 30 years ago, with reported residual lung scarring, who presents with multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations, including a right upper lobe tumor with an exon 19 deletion, and a right middle lobe tumor with an exon 21 mutation, presenting for consultation and to assume care of lung adenocarcinoma currently maintained on erlotinib with stable disease since 04/21/2015.     #1 Suspected multiple lung adenocarcinomas showing ground glass opacities on CT vs stage IV lung adenocarcinoma (contralateral lung lesion)    I reviewed her case extensively with Durham, MD, thoracic oncology. We think it is likely that these distinct adenocarcinomas are separate, and that this does not represent stage IV non-small cell lung cancer with a contralateral lung lesion (PMID [000000]).    We are interested in seeing whether she has a germline EGFR mutation  (T790M) , given her family history and her multiple other EGFR mutations that have been tested (PMID [000000]). We will plan to review her case and thoracic tumor board next Tuesday, to discuss with our pathologists and radiologists, as well as our surgeons, quite possibly that we may be able to treat her more aggressively with curative intent, if we would be able to resect the right upper lobe lesion, but we will plan to discuss this further.     There is also some question as to whether she is deriving any benefit at all from being on her erlotinib, aside from the side effects she is experiencing. She will plan to obtain CT scans and chest x-rays that she has had done remotely. All we have are the last 2 years of scans, and Dr. Platt will plan to liaise with her following thoracic tumor board next Tuesday.    SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS:   1. The patient will plan to drop-off CT scans and chest x-rays that she has had in the past for comparison purposes.  2. We will review her case and thoracic tumor board next week.  3. Referral to supportive dermato-oncology for recommendations regarding TKI-associated dermatopathy.    This patient was seen and discussed with Dr. Earvin Ziel, thoracic oncology. The patient and her husband had the opportunity to ask questions and they were answered to their satisfaction.    Ved Jaworski, MD    Teaching Physician Attestation  I was present and directly participated during the history and physical examination with  the fellow.    I saw and examined the patient, reviewed scans as outlined in the note, and discussed management with the fellow.

Although you quite familiar with her history, please allow us to review it here for our records.     Ms. Keilah Chan-Klosterman is a very pleasant 56-year-old female with a past medical history of latent tuberculosis treated for 6 months with isoniazid approximately 20 years ago with reported residual lung scarring. In 12/22/2013 she developed a \"cold\" and underwent a CT scan of the chest. According to Ms. Chan-Klosterman, it showed scarring and possible infection. She was treated with antibiotics and did well and then in the summer of 2014 she developed atypical chest pain, prompting them to order a CT for evaluation in 10/22/2014 revealing right upper lobe scarring/nodule. The recommendation at that time was to follow with serial CTs. She underwent a repeat CT of the chest in 01/22/2015 that did not show any significant change, but she was recommended to undergo a  biopsy. On 02/21/2015, she underwent a right upper lobe CT-guided biopsy that demonstrated adenocarcinoma with exon 19 deletion and EGFR. Subsequent staging included MRI of the brain which was negative. A PET-CT scan revealed 3 focal lesions; 1 in the right upper lobe which was biopsied, as well as a right middle lobe lesion, and then a left upper lobe suspicious lesion as well. She does not have any extrathoracic disease. In 03/22/2015, she underwent a CT-guided biopsy of the left upper lobe which revealed suspicious cells. Cannot rule out carcinoma. In 04/21/2015, she underwent mediastinoscopy with negative lymph nodes. She was also scheduled to undergo surgery in Sacramento  which included a partial right middle lobe resection.    Ultimately, the surgeon aborted the procedure for unclear reasons.    According to op notes, there were 2 nodules in the right middle lobe, and he took a wedge resection of the larger lesion in the right middle lobe. The intention was to do a right middle lobe resection, a right upper lobectomy, and then later do a wedge of the left upper lobe suspicious lesion. Pathology in the right middle lobe partial wedge resection demonstrated a separate exon 21 EGFR mutation. Two weeks following surgery, on 04/28/2015, she started Tarceva or erlotinib 150 mg daily. In 05/22/2015, erlotinib dose was reduced to 100 mg due to skin side effects. In 06/21/2015, she underwent surveillance chest imaging which demonstrated stable disease. On 09/06/2025, she underwent a CT of the chest which demonstrated stable disease. There were no intracranial findings on MRI.PFT\\'s on 03/15/2015 revealed FVC of 105% predicted, FEV1 96% predicted and DLCO 105% predicted.    Her case was discussed at the Thoracic Multidisciplinary Tumor Board on 10/10/2015, and the recommendation was for surgical resection of the right upper lobe, possible right middle lobe, and SABR to the left lung lesion.     On today\\'s  visit, she is maintained on Tarceva 100 mg. She is doing relatively well. She works full time as a nurse. She only has some dry skin and a faint rash but reports it is significantly improved. Overall, her performance status is 0-1. A 14-point review of systems is negative except as noted in the above HPI.    Past Medical History: LTBI treated for 6 months with INH in her early 30s and also adenocarcinoma of the lung.    Past Surgical History: Had a cholecystectomy in 2013.    Allergies: Latex, codeine, and penicillin.    Current Medications: ProAir 88 mcg, QVAR 80 mcg, Zyrtec 5 mg, ciclopirox 8% topical solution, Tarceva 100 mg, Pepcid 40 mg, Flonase 50 mcg, Minocin 100 mg, and triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% ointment.    Social History: She is a lifetime nonsmoker. Works as a nurse at South Grafton  in the family medicine department. No significant alcohol or drug use. She was born in Missoula .    Family History: Mother, a never smoker, died of lung cancer metastatic to brain at age 59. Her uncle was a nonsmoker and died of lung cancer at age 82.    Imaging: Reviewed in clinic today. As described above in the HPI.    Physical Exam: Current vital signs: Temp 98.2, pulse 86, blood pressure 115/70, respirations 18, O2 saturation is 99% on room air. Current weight 57.7 kg. On general appearance, she is awake, alert, not in acute distress. Skin: Dry. Evidence of upper and lower extremity very faint petechiae associated with a papular rash on the hands as well as skin fissuring. Lymph nodes: No cervical, supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Musculoskeletal: Large and small joints of the upper and lower extremities she had a normal range of motion. No significant erythema or joint effusions. Chest: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. No significant large venous collaterals on the chest or upper thorax. HEENT: Oral mucosa is moist. There are occasional canker sores. No thrush. Lungs: Clear to  auscultation bilaterally.    Respirations even and unlabored. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended. No palpable hepatosplenomegaly. Normal speech. Normal gait. Normal, nonfocal cranial nerves. Strength, sensory, and cerebellar exams normal. Psych: Mood and affect are normal and appropriate.    Impression And Plan: Ms. Murphy Zaid is a very pleasant 56-year-old patient with a pertinent medical history of latent tuberculosis infection status post 6 months of isoniazid completed 20 years ago with the report of residual lung scarring who presents with multi-focal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations including a right upper lobe tumor with an exon 19 lesion and a right middle lobe tumor with an exon 21 mutation who presented for consultation for surgical resection. She is currently maintained on erlotinib with stable disease since 04/21/2015. Her case was presented at our multidisciplinary tumor board on 10/10/2025 with the recommendation for surgical resection of the right lung and SABR to the left lung. Dr. Spurgeon reviewed all images and information with Ms. Chan-Klosterman and her husband at today\\'s visit and the recommendations. We recommend that she undergo a flexible bronchoscopy, right VATS bilobectomy of right middle lobe and right upper lobe with possible thoracotomy and SABR to the left lung tumor. Dr. Ferrari reviewed the surgery in detail with Ms. Leung and her husbands she has given informed consent for the procedure after discussion of the risks and benefits, during which the patient and her husband had the opportunity to ask questions and have them answered to their satisfaction. Risks discussed include bleeding, infection, prolonged air leak, arrhythmia, need for conversion to a thoracotomy, and pneumonia. Surgery is planned for 11/16/2015. She will return back to our clinic on 11/13/2015 for a preoperative visit. We have aslo placed a to Radiation Oncology at the request of  Ms. Klosterman to discuss SABR to her left lung tumor. Ms. Thibodeau and her husband had all their questions and concerns addressed at today\\'s visit and agree with the plan.     Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of Ms. Keilah Chan-Klosterman. Please feel free to contact our office for any questions or concerns.     Sincerely,    Kory Estevez, NP    Dirk Abella,  MD  Signed by Shihadeh, Moishy Wagener, MD on 10/30/2015 at 1041    I, Monte Ellard, MD, personally saw the patient and performed a substantive portion of this E/M visit face-to-face with the same patient on the same date of service with the Advanced Practice Provider (APP). I was personally involved in reviewing and conducting elements of the history, physical exam, radiographic and/or laboratory studies, and/or medical decision making, and I agree with and edited the above document where appropriate.         Mrs. Klosterman has multiple lung lesions (RUL x 2, RML, LUL) and is now status post mediastinoscopy and RML wedge resection for T1aN0 adenocarcinoma that was EGFR positive. Per the operative report, she had at least one additional RML lung lesion which was not resected, however the final pathology demonstrated negative margins on the wedge resection specimen. At our Multidisciplinary Tumor Board we discussed her as having multifocal adenocarcinoma with stable disease, but incompletely treated. We would advocate for a combined approach to her residual disease which would include a RUL/RML bilobectomy combined with SABR to the LUL lesion. She seemed agreeable with this tentative plan. We will see her back following completion of her workup with repeat PET.

She describes the rash as a burning rash that spread and evolved into open sores., The pain was a 6/10, and described as a burning, sharp pain that was constant, without a predictable pattern. The rash was also accompanied by fissures in the skin and nail changes. Patient states that the sharp, burning pain has been has only been relieved with dose reduction of erlotinib from 150 mg to 100 mg in 06/21/2015. The rashes started to fade at that time but then immedtiately returned, at which point the patient was prescribed triamcinolone ointment. Patient states that fingernail changes began approximately 4 months ago with the changing of her nail and the coloring. Approximately 1 month ago the nail  bed started to peel. The patient currently uses triamcinolone ointment to new developing rash. This helps her pain but she is concerned about dyspigmentation. Pt also applies Carmex to open fissures, as well as antibiotic ointment. The patient also uses Cetaphil moisturizer and Folse cream moisturizer. Pt has not ever experienced symptoms like this before. The patient denies constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, arthralgias, myalgias or fatigue.  No personal or family history of skin cancers.    1. Favor eczematous dermatitis in the setting of xerosis from EGFRi therapy:  Patient showed us pictures of what the lesions looked like at the beginning of erlotinib therapy and resemble nummular dermatitis. Discussed with the patient that triamcinolone is a good medication for the skin lesions that appear on the arms, legs and body. However, it is not recommended for the face, axillae or groin. The use of desonide is more appropriate for use on the the face.  Examination with hyperpigmented patches and macules in areas of prior eruption. No new lesions on today\\'s exam  - Apply TAC 0.1% ointment to body. Avoid face, axillary, and groin areas. Discussed risks including but not limited to atrophy, striae, dyspigmentation, acneiform eruption, bruising.  - Start desonide 0.05% to AA on face BID  - Appropriate dry skin care reviewed    2. Onychorrhexis:  Examination with dystrophy and discoloration of the nails of the hand primarily on bilateral index fingers  - Cater once daily to nails  - Consider addition of biotin  - Avoid trauma    3. Melasma:  Patient concerned about discoloration on her face and arms with the development of these lesions. We explained to the patient that the skin changes can occur for weeks to months after completion of the therapy. Advised to use sunscreen to help prevent skin darkening.  For darkening of the skin of the face and cheeks, we recommended use of  hydroquinone daily for 2-3 months. We did not recommend any further use past 2 or 3 months due to risk of ochronosis.  Examination with brown patches of the skin primarily of cheeks, periorbital skin.  - Hydroquinone daily for 2-3 months. Discussed SEs of medication as noted above as well as irritation.  - Advised pt to utilize broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF of at least 30    4. Skin fissures on the hands, and feet 2/2 erlotinib:  Examination without painful fissures at this time, but with diffuser xerosis.  - Advised to use Vaseline on hands and feet at night, with cotton glove occlusion to help moisturize hands and prevent cracking  - Dermabond to open painful fissures    The patient also had questions regarding skin preparation in anticipation of radiation therapy. We advised the patient to wash with gentle soap and water and to start Cetaphil moisturizers. When on active radiation therapy we recommended thick coats of Vaseline. Radiation oncology likely to discuss bleach soaks/baths with pt. Can also consider addition of topical steroid.

If you have any questions please call 999-999-9999, choose option #5, and ask to leave a message with the Nurse Coordinator, Heather Ratcliffe. Please also feel free to email us through MyHealth with any questions or concerns.       PLEASE RETURN TO THE CLINIC IN:  4-6 weeks    To schedule a follow-up appointment, you may do so when you check out OR call 999-999-9999, press option #1.  Appointments made on Monday and Thursday will be located at 900 Rancho Cucamonga , on the 3rd Floor. This is right across the walkway in the Women\\'s Cancer Center Building.   Appointments made on Tuesday will be located at 2589 Gurdon , Ashland  on the 3rd floor.  Appointments made on Fridays will be located at 450 Golden Valley , Pavilion B, Fourth Floor in Dobson . The phone number is 999-999-9999.      RECOMMENDATIONS WE DISCUSSED:    For face - lesser strength topical steroid, Desonide, would be more appropriate.  You can apply twice a day.    For dark spots on face - can apply hydroquinone once a day for 3 months, this most likely will not be covered by insurance because it is for cosmetic purpose.    For hands - use Aquaphor or Vaseline then wear white cotton gloves overnight    Dermabond or Super Glue - apply to any open cracks on hands and feet    For nails - apply Nuvail solution once a day - if not covered, can purchase Drew Feiler\\'s Hard as Nails or any over the counter nail hardner    RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DRY/SENSITIVE SKIN   1. Use lukewarm water for showers and bathing- avoid HOT or COLD water.   2. Do NOT vigorously scrub your skin with a washcloth, sponge, or brush.   3. Use very little soap, and only in areas where needed. A mild soap such as Basis, unscented Dove, Purpose or Oil of Olay fragrance-free is recommended. Bar soap is better than liquid soap.  4. If your skin is very dry, you can try  Cetaphil gentle cleansing lotion or bar, Aquanil or CeraVe cleansers as alternatives to soap bar soap.  5. For bathing, either soak in a clean tub of water or take a shower for no more than10 minutes. Always apply a moisturizer immediately after bathing. Try to apply the moisturizer within 3 minutes of getting out of the bath or shower. This is also the best time to apply your prescription creams or ointments.   6. Do not use bubblebath.   7. After bathing, Ancona your skin with a towel to dry gently, do not rub.   8. Use Fragrance-free moisturizers (such as Lubriderm, Saint Jo , Aveeno, Curel, CeraVe or Cetaphil lotion in the summer and Eucerin calming cream, DML Forte, Cetaphil cream, CeraVe cream, Aquaphor or Vaseline jelly in winter) one to several times a day to the whole body, especially after bathing, to ¿lock-in¿ moisture.   9. Do NOT use colognes, perfumes, sprays, powders etc. on your skin.   10. Use a small amount of Fragrance-free laundry products such as All free and clear, Dreft, Seventh Generation, Method or Tide-Free. Do NOT use fabric softener or Dryer sheets. You can also double rinse your clothes after washing.   11. Prescription creams and ointments should be applied as directed to affected areas only. Moisturizers are best applied to the whole body at different times as prescriptions; if applied at the same time as prescription ointments or creams, always apply the prescription medication first.   12. Do not wear tight or rough clothing. Wool clothes can be irritating. Pre-wash new clothes before wearing.   13. Avoid saunas and steam baths - keep environmental temperatures on the cooler side.   14. For extreme dryness, a humidifier or vaporizer may help your environment. Remember to keep it clean or molds may spread throughout the humidified area.   15. If your skin is extremely sensitive, the Vanicream skin care and hair care line is highly recommended.

She describes the rash as a burning rash that spread and evolved into open sores., The pain was a 6/10, and described as a burning, sharp pain that was constant, without a predictable pattern. The rash was also accompanied by fissures in the skin and nail changes. Patient states that the sharp, burning pain has been has only been relieved with dose reduction of erlotinib from 150 mg to 100 mg in 06/21/2015. The rashes started to fade at that time but then immedtiately returned, at which point the patient was prescribed triamcinolone ointment. Patient states that fingernail changes began approximately 4 months ago with the changing of her nail and the coloring. Approximately 1 month ago the nail bed started to peel. The patient currently uses triamcinolone ointment to new developing rash. This helps her pain but she is concerned about dyspigmentation. Pt also applies Carmex to open fissures, as well as antibiotic ointment. The patient also uses Cetaphil moisturizer and Steffes cream moisturizer. Pt has not ever experienced symptoms like this before. The patient denies constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, arthralgias,  myalgias or fatigue.  No personal or family history of skin cancers.    1. Favor eczematous dermatitis in the setting of xerosis from EGFRi therapy:  Patient showed us pictures of what the lesions looked like at the beginning of erlotinib therapy and resemble nummular dermatitis. Discussed with the patient that triamcinolone is a good medication for the skin lesions that appear on the arms, legs and body. However, it is not recommended for the face, axillae or groin. The use of desonide is more appropriate for use on the the face.  Examination with hyperpigmented patches and macules in areas of prior eruption. No new lesions on today\\'s exam  - Apply TAC 0.1% ointment to body. Avoid face, axillary, and groin areas. Discussed risks including but not limited to atrophy, striae, dyspigmentation, acneiform eruption, bruising.  - Start desonide 0.05% to AA on face BID  - Appropriate dry skin care reviewed    2. Onychorrhexis:  Examination with dystrophy and discoloration of the nails of the hand primarily on bilateral index fingers  - Jude once daily to nails  - Consider addition of biotin  - Avoid trauma    3. Melasma:  Patient concerned about discoloration on her face and arms with the development of these lesions. We explained to the patient that the skin changes can occur for weeks to months after completion of the therapy. Advised to use sunscreen to help prevent skin darkening.  For darkening of the skin of the face and cheeks, we recommended use of hydroquinone daily for 2-3 months. We did not recommend any further use past 2 or 3 months due to risk of ochronosis.  Examination with brown patches of the skin primarily of cheeks, periorbital skin.  - Hydroquinone daily for 2-3 months. Discussed SEs of medication as noted above as well as irritation.  - Advised pt to utilize broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF of at least 30    4. Skin fissures on the hands, and feet 2/2 erlotinib:  Examination without painful  fissures at this time, but with diffuser xerosis.  - Advised to use Vaseline on hands and feet at night, with cotton glove occlusion to help moisturize hands and prevent cracking  - Dermabond to open painful fissures    The patient also had questions regarding skin preparation in anticipation of radiation therapy. We advised the patient to wash with gentle soap and water and to start Cetaphil moisturizers. When on active radiation therapy we recommended thick coats of Vaseline. Radiation oncology likely to discuss bleach soaks/baths with pt. Can also consider addition of topical steroid.

Although you quite familiar with her history, please allow us to review it here for our records.     Ms. Wynter Chan-Swink is a very pleasant 56-year-old female with a past medical history of latent tuberculosis treated for 6 months with isoniazid approximately 20 years ago with reported residual lung scarring. In 12/22/2013 she developed a \"cold\" and underwent a CT scan of the chest. According to Ms. Chan-Swink, it showed scarring and possible infection. She was treated with antibiotics and did well and then in the summer of 2014 she developed atypical chest pain, prompting them to order a CT for evaluation in 10/22/2014 revealing right upper lobe scarring/nodule. The recommendation at that time was to follow with serial CTs. She underwent a repeat CT of the chest in 01/22/2015 that did not show any significant change, but she was recommended to undergo a biopsy. On 02/21/2015, she underwent a right upper lobe CT-guided biopsy that demonstrated adenocarcinoma with exon 19 deletion and EGFR. Subsequent staging included MRI of the brain which was negative. A PET-CT scan revealed 3 focal lesions; 1 in the right upper lobe which was biopsied, as well as a right middle lobe lesion, and then a left upper lobe suspicious lesion as well. She does not have any extrathoracic disease. In 03/22/2015, she underwent a CT-guided biopsy of the left upper lobe which revealed suspicious cells. Cannot rule  out carcinoma. In 04/21/2015, she underwent mediastinoscopy with negative lymph nodes. She was also scheduled to undergo surgery in Fairbanks  which included a partial right middle lobe resection. Ultimately, the surgeon aborted the procedure for unclear reasons. According to op notes, there were 2 nodules in the right middle lobe, and he took a wedge resection of the larger lesion in the right middle lobe. The intention was to do a right middle lobe resection, a right upper lobectomy, and then later do a wedge of the left upper lobe suspicious lesion. Pathology in the right middle lobe partial wedge resection demonstrated a separate exon 21 EGFR mutation. Two weeks following surgery, on 04/28/2015, she started Tarceva or erlotinib 150 mg daily. In 05/22/2015, erlotinib dose was reduced to 100 mg due to skin side effects. In 06/21/2015, she underwent surveillance chest imaging which demonstrated stable disease. On 09/06/2025, she underwent a CT of the chest which demonstrated stable disease. There were no intracranial findings on MRI.PFT\\'s on 03/15/2015 revealed FVC of 105% predicted, FEV1 96% predicted and DLCO 105% predicted.    Her case was discussed at the Thoracic Multidisciplinary Tumor Board on 10/10/2015, and the recommendation was for surgical resection of the right upper lobe, possible right middle lobe, and SABR to the left lung lesion.     On today\\'s visit, she is maintained on Tarceva 100 mg. She is doing relatively well. She works full time as a nurse. She only has some dry skin and a faint rash but reports it is significantly improved. Overall, her performance status is 0-1. A 14-point review of systems is negative except as noted in the above HPI.    Past Medical History: LTBI treated for 6 months with INH in her early 30s and also adenocarcinoma of the lung.    Past Surgical History: Had a cholecystectomy in 2013.    Allergies: Latex, codeine, and penicillin.    Current Medications: ProAir  88 mcg, QVAR 80 mcg, Zyrtec 5 mg, ciclopirox 8% topical solution, Tarceva 100 mg, Pepcid 40 mg, Flonase 50 mcg, Minocin 100 mg, and triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% ointment.    Social History: She is a lifetime nonsmoker. Works as a nurse at Arcadia  in the family medicine department. No significant alcohol or drug use. She was born in Elk Mound .    Family History: Mother, a never smoker, died of lung cancer metastatic to brain at age 59. Her uncle was a nonsmoker and died of lung cancer at age 82.    Imaging: Reviewed in clinic today. As described above in the HPI.    Physical Exam: Current vital signs: Temp 98.2, pulse 86, blood pressure 115/70, respirations 18, O2 saturation is 99% on room air. Current weight 57.7 kg. On general appearance, she is awake, alert, not in acute distress. Skin: Dry. Evidence of upper and lower extremity very faint petechiae associated with a papular rash on the hands as well as skin fissuring. Lymph nodes: No cervical, supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Musculoskeletal: Large and small joints of the upper and lower extremities she had a normal range of motion. No significant erythema or joint effusions. Chest: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. No significant large venous collaterals on the chest or upper thorax. HEENT: Oral mucosa is moist. There are occasional canker sores. No thrush. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Respirations even and unlabored. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended. No palpable hepatosplenomegaly. Normal speech. Normal gait. Normal, nonfocal cranial nerves. Strength, sensory, and cerebellar exams normal.  Psych: Mood and affect are normal and appropriate.    Impression And Plan: Ms. Wynter Chan-Swink is a very pleasant 56-year-old patient with a pertinent medical history of latent tuberculosis infection status post 6 months of isoniazid completed 20 years ago with the report of residual lung scarring who presents  with multi-focal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations including a right upper lobe tumor with an exon 19 lesion and a right middle lobe tumor with an exon 21 mutation who presented for consultation for surgical resection. She is currently maintained on erlotinib with stable disease since 04/21/2015. Her case was presented at our multidisciplinary tumor board on 10/10/2025 with the recommendation for surgical resection of the right lung and SABR to the left lung. Dr. Cueva reviewed all images and information with Ms. Taqi and her husband at today\\'s visit and the recommendations. We recommend that she undergo a flexible bronchoscopy, right VATS bilobectomy of right middle lobe and right upper lobe with possible thoracotomy and SABR to the left lung tumor. Dr. Vidaurri reviewed the surgery in detail with Ms. Chan-Swink and her husbands she has given informed consent for the procedure after discussion of the risks and benefits, during which the patient and her husband had the opportunity to ask questions and have them answered to their satisfaction. Risks discussed include bleeding, infection, prolonged air leak, arrhythmia, need for conversion to a thoracotomy, and pneumonia. Surgery is planned for 11/16/2015. She will return back to our clinic on 11/13/2015 for a preoperative visit. We have aslo placed a to  Radiation Oncology at the request of Ms. Swink to discuss SABR to her left lung tumor. Ms. Chan-Swink and her husband had all their questions and concerns addressed at today\\'s visit and agree with the plan.     Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of Ms. Warren Jackowski. Please feel free to contact our office for any questions or concerns.     Sincerely,            Esteban Haddadin, NP    I, Phillip Pitman, MD, personally saw the patient and performed a substantive portion of this E/M visit face-to-face with the same patient on the same date of service with the Advanced  Practice Provider (APP). I was personally involved in reviewing and conducting elements of the history, physical exam, radiographic and/or laboratory studies, and/or medical decision making, and I agree with and edited the above document where appropriate.   Mrs. Swink has multiple lung lesions (RUL x 2, RML, LUL) and is now  status post mediastinoscopy and RML wedge resection for T1aN0 adenocarcinoma that was EGFR positive.  Per the operative report, she had at least one additional RML lung lesion which was not resected, however the final pathology demonstrated negative margins on the wedge resection specimen.  At our Multidisciplinary Tumor Board we discussed her as having multifocal adenocarcinoma with stable disease, but incompletely treated. We would advocate for a combined approach to her residual disease which would include a RUL/RML bilobectomy combined with SABR to the LUL lesion.  She seemed agreeable with this tentative plan.  We will see her back following completion of her workup with repeat PET.

The remainder of  the bilateral lung densities appear unchanged.    No evidence of metastatic disease within the abdomen or pelvis.    Minimal new atelectasis within the right middle lobe.    Severe atrophy of the left kidney again noted. There is moderate  dilatation of the entire left ureter as well as mild dilatation of  the left renal pelvis.    #pul2: Pulmonary nodule for which follow-up CT may be appropriate  depending on the clinical context.    03/08/2015: PET CT- Kaiser  1. ~4.5 x 2.5 x 5.4 cm irregular mixed nodular and groundglass  mass in the right upper lobe with heterogenous mild-to-moderate  FDG activity is the known adenocarcinoma.    2. Faintly or mildly FDG-avid nodular irregular opacity in the  right upper lobe along the major fissure and additional irregular  mixed nodular and groundglass mass in the left upper lobe abutting  the posteromedial pleural surface are also suspicious for indolent  malignancy such as adenocarcinoma and concerning for multicentric  adenocarcinoma.    3. No obvious FDG-avid lymph nodes in the hilar regions or  mediastinum although sensitivity for detection of metastases in  these regions is decrease given mild metabolism of the primary  lung malignancy.    4.

Consensus of thoracic tumor board to proceed with surgical resection of the RUL and RML and SABR  to the left lung lesion.     We discussed that the consensus of the tumor board was she likely has separate lung primaries as she has different EGFR mutations in the right lung (exon 19 and exon 21) and did not have stage IV disease with a contralateral lung lesion in the LUL and to treat more aggressively with surgical resection of the right lung and SABR to the LUL lung nodule. There is a question if she possibly harbors a germline EGFR mutation (T790M) given her family history and multiple EGFR mutations. We will plan to run molecular testing after her surgery.     We discussed that we agree to treat with a curative intent, however, there is a high likelihood of recurrence in the future.  Discussed radiotherapy could be considered for a local recurrence or an EGFR targeted therapy if systemic treatment is warranted and that aggressive treatment now would delay recurrence for as long as possible.     We recommend she remain on tarceva for now and discontinue 3 days prior to her surgery on 11/16/2015.     We will plan for her to return after her surgery for follow up. She will proceed with a post operative visit with Dr. Arizmendi on 11/13/2015 with planned flexible bronchosocpy, right VATS bilovectomy of the RUL and RML with possible thoracotomy on 11/16/2015. She will meet with Dr Corbin next week to discuss SABR.      As usual, we encouraged the patient to contact us sooner should she develop any new symptoms or have any questions or concerns.    The patient was seen with Dr. Nathan Khatibi, attending physician, who agrees with the above assessment and plan.

Yuliana Khalili, MD   Primary Care Doctor    RE: Gummadi, Crystal   MRN: [000000]  DOB: 03/04/1959    Dear Colleagues,    Identification: Willie Jolley is a 56-year-old, never smoker, Asian female with multifocal adenocarcinomas of the lung, 2 of which have been biopsy-proven with separate EGFR mutations. She is seen in consultation at the request of Dr. Inez Luke for consideration of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy to a left upper lobe presumed T2a N0 adenocarcinoma. She is seen along with her husband.    History Of Present Illness: The patient developed chest pain in 2014. Chest CT on 10/16/2014, in the Goldner system, showed a 4.2 x 2.3 x 4.8 cm density in the right upper lobe with surrounding ground-glass opacity. Ground-glass opacity was seen in the left upper lobe measuring around 4 cm. There was a 2 cm ground-glass nodule in the right lower lobe.           On 02/21/2015, she underwent CT-guided biopsy of the right upper lobe lesion which demonstrated adenocarcinoma with exon 19 EGFR mutation. Brain MRI was negative.     PET-CT on 03/08/2015, confirmed the 4.5 cm mixed nodular and ground-glass mass in the right upper lobe, with  SUV of 4.7. There was a nodular irregular opacity along the right upper lobe, side of the right major fissure, with faint metabolism. There was also a mixed nodular and ground-glass nodule in the left upper lobe with mild hypermetabolism, with SUV of 1.5. There were other tiny ground-glass areas of opacity in the left upper lobe. There were no FDG avid regional lymph nodes.     On 04/21/2015, she underwent mediastinoscopy and wedge resection of a right middle lobe lesion. Mediastinoscopy showed negative lymph nodes and the wedge resection specimen had a 1.8 cm invasive adenocarcinoma with negative margins. Per Dr. Rathi\\'s note, a right upper lobectomy was also planned as part of this procedure, but was aborted. The right middle lobe resection specimen demonstrated exon 21 EGFR mutation, notably different from the right upper lobe biopsy finding. She separately underwent needle biopsy of the left upper lobe lesion; analysis was not diagnostic of cancer but these slides have not yet been reviewed here.    She began erlotinib systemic therapy on 04/28/2015.     She had a restaging CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis on 09/06/2015, which showed stable size of the right upper lobe nodule, left upper lobe ground-glass lesion, and 12 x 6 mm ground-glass density in the posterior right upper lobe adjacent to the major fissure.     She presented to Stanford for a second opinion and was discussed at the tumor board. Given the different EGFR mutations in 2 of the lesions, she was considered to likely have multiple separate early stage primary lung cancers instead of stage IV disease and a local treatment approach was recommended. She saw Dr. Capo with thoracic surgery who plans a right VATS bilobectomy (right middle and upper lobe) with possible thoracotomy on 11/16/2015. Tumor board recommendation was for stereotactic ablative radiotherapy to the left upper lobe ground-glass opacity.     The patient currently  feels well. She works as a charge nurse. She has a rash from Tarceva, and fatigue.    Allergies: Latex, codeine, penicillin.    Medications: Albuterol 90 mcg inhaler as needed, beclomethasone 80 mcg inhaler, cetirizine 5 mg, erlotinib 100 mg daily, famotidine 40 mg as needed, fluticasone nasal spray as needed, minocycline 100 mg by mouth.    Past Medical History: Latent tuberculosis treated with 6 months of isoniazid in her early 30s.    Social History: She is a never smoker. She lives in Arlington . She works as a nurse.    Family History: Mother died of metastatic lung cancer at age 59. Uncle had lung cancer, died at age 82.    Physical Exam: Vital signs: Temperature 36.8 Celsius, pulse 89, respiratory rate 19, weight 59 kg, blood pressure 115/74, oxygen saturation 99% on room air. General: Sitting in a chair, in no apparent distress. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Moist mucous membranes. Neurologic: Alert and oriented x3. Gait is normal. The remainder of the physical exam was deferred as there was a fire drill and the patient was not able to stay longer.    Laboratory Data: Creatinine 0.79 on 09/09/2015.    Imaging: I reviewed the images from her 10/16/2014 chest CT, 09/06/2015 chest CT, and 03/08/2015 PET-CT. There are multiple opacities in the right lung, several along the major and minor fissures, which may account for some of the radiology reads describing middle versus upper lobe lesions. The large right upper lobe nodule has a very small nodular solid component, but is mostly ground glass. I feel that the left upper lobe nodule is growing over time and measured greatest axial extent at 32.6 mm in 2014, and 36.6 mm in 08/22/2015.    Assessment And Plan: Ms. Gummadi is a 56-year-old never smoker with 3-4 possibly separate primary adenocarcinomas of both lungs. She had a right middle lobe nodule excised with wedge resection, thought to be adenocarcinoma. She has a biopsy-proven  right upper lobe adenocarcinoma, which is still in place.       There is a separate right upper lobe ground-glass opacity (06/21/2015, CT series 602, image 25). Finally, there is scarring in the right middle lobe, unclear if related to prior resection or residual tumor.     Dr. Anand plans resection of the right upper and right middle lobe disease. In the tumor board, we felt that it may be too morbid to also resect the left upper lobe lesion. Therefore, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy was felt to be a better option for the left upper lobe, mostly ground-glass opacity, which very likely represents an adenocarcinoma.     I discussed the stereotactic radiation procedure with Ms. Timothy and her husband. Treatment would likely be given over 4 daily fractions. I would estimate around an 85% long-term local control rate of this lesion. Acute toxicity is generally mild; later toxicities could include rib fracture or chest wall pain, lung scarring in the treated area, and smaller chances of pneumonitis or serious complications such as spinal cord damage or damage to the aorta.     Ms. Juliano is interested in proceeding with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy to the left upper lobe lesion. We will plan to perform a planning session around 2 weeks after surgery to give her time to recover and then deliver radiation 1-2 weeks after that.

Fellow     Silveira, MD   Thoracic Surgery.     Ashlyn Fairchild, MD   Primary Care Doctor    RE: Libbey, Frankie   MRN: [000000]  DOB: 03/04/1959    Dear Colleagues,    Identification: Frankie Libbey is a 56-year-old, never smoker, Asian female with multifocal adenocarcinomas of the lung, 2 of which have been biopsy-proven with separate EGFR mutations. She is seen in consultation at the request of Dr. Yusuf Duggan for consideration of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy to a left upper lobe presumed T2a N0 adenocarcinoma. She is seen along with her husband.    History Of Present Illness: The patient developed chest pain in 2014. Chest CT on 10/16/2014, in the Trachtenberg system, showed a 4.2 x 2.3 x 4.8 cm density in the right upper lobe with surrounding ground-glass opacity. Ground-glass opacity was seen in the left upper lobe measuring around 4 cm. There was a 2 cm ground-glass nodule in the right lower lobe.     On 02/21/2015, she underwent CT-guided biopsy of the right upper lobe lesion which demonstrated adenocarcinoma with exon 19 EGFR mutation. Brain MRI was negative.     PET-CT on 03/08/2015, confirmed the 4.5 cm mixed nodular and ground-glass mass in the right upper lobe, with SUV of 4.7. There was a nodular irregular opacity along the right upper lobe, side of the right major fissure, with faint metabolism. There was also a mixed nodular and ground-glass nodule in the left upper lobe with mild hypermetabolism, with SUV of 1.5. There were other tiny ground-glass areas of opacity in the left upper lobe. There were no FDG avid regional lymph nodes.     On 04/21/2015, she underwent mediastinoscopy and wedge resection of a right middle lobe lesion. Mediastinoscopy showed negative lymph nodes and the wedge resection specimen had a 1.8 cm invasive adenocarcinoma with negative  margins. Per Dr. Leary\\'s note, a right upper lobectomy was also planned as part of this procedure, but was aborted. The right middle lobe resection specimen demonstrated exon 21 EGFR mutation, notably different from the right upper lobe biopsy finding. She separately underwent needle biopsy of the left upper lobe lesion; analysis was not diagnostic of cancer but these slides have not yet been reviewed here.    She began erlotinib systemic therapy on 04/28/2015.     She had a restaging CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis on 09/06/2015, which showed stable size of the right upper lobe nodule, left upper lobe ground-glass lesion, and 12 x 6 mm ground-glass density in the posterior right upper lobe adjacent to the major fissure.     She presented to Stanford for a second opinion and was discussed at the tumor board. Given the different EGFR mutations in 2 of the lesions, she was considered to likely have multiple separate early stage primary lung cancers instead of stage IV disease and a local treatment approach was recommended. She saw Dr. Dickman with thoracic surgery who plans a right VATS bilobectomy (right middle and upper lobe) with possible thoracotomy on 11/16/2015. Tumor board recommendation was for stereotactic ablative radiotherapy to the left upper lobe ground-glass opacity.     The patient currently feels well. She works as a charge nurse. She has a rash from Tarceva, and fatigue.    Allergies: Latex, codeine, penicillin.    Medications: Albuterol 90 mcg inhaler as needed, beclomethasone 80 mcg inhaler, cetirizine 5 mg, erlotinib 100 mg daily, famotidine 40 mg as needed, fluticasone nasal spray as needed, minocycline 100 mg by mouth.    Past Medical History: Latent tuberculosis treated with 6 months of isoniazid in her early 30s.    Social History: She is a never smoker. She lives in Georgetown . She works as a nurse.    Family History: Mother died of metastatic lung cancer at age 59. Uncle had  lung cancer, died at age 82.    Physical Exam: Vital signs: Temperature 36.8 Celsius, pulse 89, respiratory rate 19, weight 59 kg, blood pressure 115/74, oxygen saturation 99% on room air. General: Sitting in a chair, in no apparent distress. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Moist mucous membranes. Neurologic: Alert and oriented x3. Gait is normal. The remainder of the physical exam was deferred as there was a fire drill and the patient was not able to stay longer.    Laboratory Data: Creatinine 0.79 on 09/09/2015.    Imaging: I reviewed the images from her 10/16/2014 chest CT, 09/06/2015 chest CT, and 03/08/2015 PET-CT. There are multiple opacities in the right lung, several along the major and minor fissures, which may account for some of the radiology reads describing middle versus upper lobe lesions. The large right upper lobe nodule has a very small nodular solid component, but is mostly ground glass. I feel that the left upper lobe nodule is growing over time and measured greatest axial extent at 32.6 mm in 2014, and 36.6 mm in 08/22/2015.    Assessment And Plan: Ms. Tack is a 56-year-old never smoker with 3-4 possibly separate primary adenocarcinomas of both lungs. She had a right middle lobe nodule excised with wedge resection, thought to be adenocarcinoma. She has a biopsy-proven right upper lobe adenocarcinoma, which is still in place. There is a separate right upper lobe ground-glass opacity (06/21/2015, CT series 602, image 25). Finally, there is scarring in the right middle lobe, unclear if related to prior resection or residual tumor.     Dr. Cuenca plans resection of the right upper and right middle lobe disease. In the tumor board, we felt that it may be too morbid to also resect the left upper lobe lesion. Therefore, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy was felt to be a better option for the left upper lobe, mostly ground-glass opacity, which very likely represents  an adenocarcinoma.     I discussed the stereotactic radiation procedure with Ms. Tejada and her husband. Treatment would likely be given over 4 daily fractions. I would estimate around an 85% long-term local control rate of this lesion. Acute toxicity is generally mild; later toxicities could include rib fracture or chest wall pain, lung scarring in the treated area, and smaller chances of pneumonitis or serious complications such as spinal cord damage or damage to the aorta.     Ms. Tart is interested in proceeding with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy to the left upper lobe lesion. We will plan to perform a planning session around 2 weeks after surgery to give her time to recover and then deliver radiation 1-2 weeks after that.

We agree with the originating pathologist\\'s diagnosis. The aspirate smear is moderately cellular and shows clusters of atypical epithelial cells with enlarged nuclei, moderate amounts of delicate cytoplasm, and variable prominent nucleoli. The core biopsies show alveolar parenchyma with focal atypical lining cells, in a lepidic pattern. The features are suspicious for a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Clinical and radiological correlation is recommended. CLINICAL HISTORY:  Per EPIC: The patient is a 56-year, never smoker, Asian female with multifocal adenocarcinomas of the lung, 2 of which have been biopsy-proven with separate EG FR mutations. Received at the request of Dr. Yoshio Amjad are 4 glass slides labeled (SCHS15-9506) courtesy of Dr. Primo Meltzer from Santa Clara Homestead Pathology in Santa Clara CA. I have reviewed the specimen and agree with the interpretation above.

WHOLE-BODY F-18 FDG PET-CT: 11/13/2015   CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 years of age, Female, with history of multifocal  adenocarcinomas of the lung, 2 of which have been biopsy-proven with  separate EGFR mutations, status post mediastinoscopy with negative  lymph nodes and wedge resection positive for invasive adenocarcinoma.    The patient is referred for evaluation of subsequent treatment  strategy planning.   COMPARISON: FDG PET/CT 03/08/2015, performed at Kaiser Santa Clara.   PROCEDURE COMMENTS:  Measured (injected) dose: 8.5 mCi. Injection site: Right antecubital.   Imaging information, imaging parameters, and additional medications: Void: The patient voided prior to the start of imaging.  Anatomical region: The area imaged included the skull base to mid  thigh. Lasix: None. Oral contrast: None. IV contrast: None.   CT dose information: Based on a 32 cm phantom, the estimated  radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam is 2.91.  The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is 262.87.   Scan technique: Following IV administration of the  radiopharmaceutical, images were acquired using the GE model 690  PET-CT scanner. A low-dose CT scan was performed for attenuation  correction and anatomic correlation only. If a comprehensive  diagnostic CT is required, the Department of Radiology should be  consulted for an adjunct CT study. Images were reconstructed and  reviewed in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. For descriptive  purposes, the maximum standard uptake value (SUV max) of  metabolically active tissues is reported in g/mL, unless stated  otherwise.   Baseline measurements: Current mean liver SUV: 2.7 g/mL. Prior mean liver SUV: 2.7 g/mL. Current mean gluteal muscle SUV: 0.6 g/mL. Prior mean gluteal muscle SUV: 0.6 g/mL.   FINDINGS:   Head and neck: Limited evaluation of the brain demonstrates intense  FDG uptake in the visualized cerebral cortex gray matter. This high  physiologic background activity reduces the sensitivity of PET for  malignant processes. Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the ocular  muscles, salivary glands, oropharynx, and vocal cords. There are no  pathologically enlarged cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes. The  thyroid gland is unremarkable.   Thorax: Non-FDG avid calcified nodule in the right lung. Postsurgical  changes are present in the right lung, adjacent to the horizontal  fissure. Slight interval improvement in the right upper lobe  ill-defined mass which measures approximately 1.5 x 4.5 cm, SUV 2.1  (previously 1.6 cm x 4.6, SUV 5.2). Interval improvement in the in  size of the lateral right upper lobe opacity, at the level of the  hilum. Relatively stable left upper lobe ill-defined nodular opacity  which measures approximately 0.7 x 2.8 cm, SUV 1.7 (previous 0.7 x  3.0 cm, SUV 1.6). Physiologic FDG uptake is present in the  myocardium. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion. The thoracic  aorta and main pulmonary artery are normal in caliber. New anterior  mediastinal nodule, 0.9 x 1.1 cm, SUV 3.2 (image 83), concerning for  malignancy.   Abdomen and pelvis: Physiologic FDG uptake is present in the liver,  spleen, and bowel. The adrenal glands and pancreas are unremarkable  on the non-contrast CT. The left kidney is atrophic. The right  kidney, ureters, and urinary bladder are visualized per clearance of  the radiotracer. Intense signal from excreted tracer limits  evaluation for malignancy in the urinary tract. The abdominal aorta  is normal in caliber. There are no pathologically enlarged or  hypermetabolic abdominal, pelvic, or inguinal lymph nodes.

As you know, Ms. Izabelle Chan-Dowden is a very pleasant 56-year-old female with a past medical history of latent tuberculosis treated for 6 months with isoniazid approximately 20 years ago with reported residual lung scarring. In 12/22/2013, she developed a \"cold\" and underwent a CT scan of the chest. According to Ms Scotland, it showed scarring and possible infection. She was treated with antibiotics and did well. Then, in the summer of 2014, she developed atypical chest pain, prompting them to order a CT for evaluation in 10/22/2014 revealing right upper lobe scarring/nodule. The recommendation at that time was to follow up with serial CTs. She underwent a repeat CT of the chest in 01/22/2015 that did not show any significant change, but she was recommended to undergo a biopsy. On 02/21/2015, she underwent a right upper lobe CT-guided biopsy that demonstrated  adenocarcinoma with exon 19 deletion and EGFR. Subsequent staging included MRI of the brain which was negative.    A PET scan revealed 3 focal lesions, 1 in the right upper lobe which was biopsied, as well as a right middle lobe lesion, and then a left upper lobe suspicious lesion as well. She does not have any extrathoracic disease. In 03/22/2015, she underwent a CT-guided biopsy of the left upper lobe which revealed suspicious cells, cannot rule out carcinoma. In 04/21/2015, she underwent a mediastinoscopy with negative lymph nodes. She was also scheduled to undergo surgery in Littlefield  which included a partial right middle lobe resection. Ultimately, the surgeon aborted the procedure for unclear reasons. According to op note, there were 2 nodules in the right middle lobe, and he took a wedge resection of the larger lesion in the right middle lobe. The intention was to do a right middle lobe resection, a right upper lobectomy, and then later do a wedge of the left upper lobe suspicious lesion. Pathology in the right middle lobe partial wedge resection demonstrated a separate exon 21 EGFR mutation. Two weeks following surgery, on 04/28/2015, she started Tarceva or erlotinib 150 mg daily. In 05/22/2015, erlotinib dose was reduced to 100 mg due to skin side effects. In 06/21/2015, she underwent surveillance chest imaging which demonstrated stable disease. On 09/06/2025, she underwent a CT of the chest which demonstrated stable disease. There were no intracranial findings on MRI. PFTs on 03/15/2015, revealed FVC of 105% predicted, FEV1 96% predicted, and DLCO 105% predicted.     Her case was discussed at our thoracic oncology multidisciplinary tumor board on 10/10/2015. The recommendation was for surgical resection of the right upper lobe, with possible right middle lobe, and SABR to the left lung lesion. She was last seen in our clinic on 10/23/2015, after reviewing all her information and imaging, and  recommended that she undergo a flexible bronchoscopy, right VATS bilobectomy of the right middle lobe and right upper lobe with possible thoracotomy, and SABR to the left lung tumor. Prior to scheduling her for surgery, which was initially scheduled for 11/16/2015, we wanted her to undergo an updated whole body PET-CT scan. She returns back to our thoracic surgery clinic with a new PET-CT scan for review.     Since her last visit, Ms Pillsbury continues to be doing well overall. She continues to work full time as a nurse and is maintained on Tarceva 100 mg. A 14-point review of systems is otherwise negative.    Imaging:  PET-CT scan on 11/14/2015, shows non-FDG avid calcified nodule in the right lung. Postsurgical changes are present in the right lung adjacent to the horizontal fissure. There is slight interval improvement in the right upper lobe ill-defined mass which measures approximately 1.5 x 4.5 cm with SUV of 2.1, previously measuring 1.6 cm x 4.6 with SUV of 5.2. Interval improvement in the size of the right upper lobe opacity at the level of the hilum. Relatively stable left upper lobe ill-defined nodular opacity which measures approximately 0.7 x 2.8 cm with SUV 1.7, previously 0.7 x 3.0 cm with SUV of 1.6. There are no pleural or pericardial effusions. There is a new anterior mediastinal nodule measuring 0.9 x 1.1 cm, SUV of 3.2, which is concerning for malignancy.    Physical Examination: Current vital signs: Temp 98.0, pulse 99, respirations 18, blood pressure 119/83, O2 saturation 100% on room air, current weight 138 pounds. General Appearance: She is awake, alert, in no acute distress. Lymph nodes: No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Musculoskeletal: In large and small joints of the upper and lower extremities, she has normal range of motion, no significant erythema or joint effusion. Chest: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1, S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. HEENT: Oral  mucosa is moist. No thrush. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Respirations even and nonlabored. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended. No palpable hepatosplenomegaly. Neurologic: Normal speech. Normal gait. Normal nonfocal cranial nerves. Strength, sensory, and cerebellar exams normal. Psych: Mood and affect are normal and appropriate.    Impression And Plan: Ms Izabelle Chan-Dowden is a very pleasant 56-year-old female with a pertinent medical history of latent tuberculosis infection, status post 6 months of isoniazid completed 20 years ago, with report of residual lung scarring who presents with multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, including a right upper lobe tumor with an exon 19 lesion and right middle lobe tumor with an exon 21 mutation, who presents for consultation for surgical resection. She is currently maintained on erlotinib with stable disease since 04/21/2015. Her case was presented at our multidisciplinary tumor board on 10/10/2025 where the recommendation was for surgical resection of the right lung and SABR to the left lung. Her most recent PET-CT scan shows a new anterior mediastinal nodule with mild hypermetabolic activity which is concerning for metastatic disease. Dr. Sontag reviewed her recent images with Ms Zigler at length today and discussed that this new mediastinal nodule is concerning for progression of disease, and we cancelled her surgery that was scheduled for 11/16/2025 until we further evaluate if this is, indeed, a progression of her disease. We discussed with Odalys Polavarapu today that we will discuss her case at our multidisciplinary tumor board tomorrow, and what they recommend. We discussed with Illiana Minnick that if we get the consensus of the tumor board that if they think the mediastinal nodule is Benign if we should proceed with the recommended surgery. If the concern is for possible metastasis, then we  discussed possible chemoradiation treatment with no surgery or possibly proceeding with a possible left VATS biopsy of this mediastinal nodule and proceed with the recommended surgery to the right lung and SABR to be mediastinal nodule and left lung. We informed Felecia Hussain that we will contact her once her case is discussed at our tumor board with the recommendations. Tiarra Zielinski had all her questions and concerns addressed at today\\'s visit and agrees with the plan.     Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of Ms Gorge Tufts. Please feel free to contact our office for any questions or concerns.

She continues to work full time as a nurse and is maintained  on Tarceva 100 mg.  A 14-point review of systems is otherwise negative.    Imaging:  PET-CT scan on 11/14/2015, shows non-FDG avid calcified nodule in the right lung. Postsurgical changes are present in the right lung adjacent to the horizontal fissure. There is slight interval improvement in the right upper lobe ill-defined mass which measures approximately 1.5 x 4.5 cm with SUV of 2.1, previously measuring 1.6 cm x 4.6 with SUV of 5.2. Interval improvement in the size of the right upper lobe opacity at the level of the hilum. Relatively stable left upper lobe ill-defined nodular opacity which measures approximately 0.7 x 2.8 cm with SUV 1.7, previously 0.7 x 3.0 cm with SUV of 1.6. There are no pleural or pericardial effusions. There is a new anterior mediastinal nodule measuring 0.9 x 1.1 cm, SUV of 3.2, which is concerning for malignancy.    Physical Examination: Current vital signs: Temp 98.0, pulse 99, respirations 18, blood pressure 119/83, O2 saturation 100% on room air, current weight 138 pounds. General Appearance: She is awake, alert, in no acute distress. Lymph nodes: No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Musculoskeletal: In large and small joints of the upper and lower extremities, she has normal range of motion, no significant erythema or joint effusion. Chest: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1, S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. HEENT: Oral mucosa is moist. No thrush. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Respirations even and nonlabored. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended. No palpable hepatosplenomegaly. Neurologic: Normal speech. Normal gait. Normal nonfocal cranial nerves. Strength, sensory, and cerebellar exams normal. Psych: Mood and affect are normal and appropriate.    Impression And Plan: Ms Sylvie Chan-Zindel is a very pleasant 56-year-old female with a pertinent medical history of latent tuberculosis infection, status post 6 months of isoniazid completed 20 years ago,  with report of residual lung scarring who presents with multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, including a right upper lobe tumor with an exon 19 lesion and right middle lobe tumor with an exon 21 mutation, who presents for consultation for surgical resection. She is currently maintained on erlotinib with stable disease since 04/21/2015. Her case was presented at our multidisciplinary tumor board on 10/10/2025 where the recommendation was for surgical resection of the right lung and SABR to the left lung. Her most recent PET-CT scan shows a new anterior mediastinal nodule with mild hypermetabolic activity which is concerning for metastatic disease. Dr. Schurtz reviewed her recent images with Ms Chan-Zindel at length today and discussed that this new mediastinal nodule is concerning for progression of disease, and we cancelled her surgery that was scheduled for 11/16/2025 until we further evaluate if this is, indeed, a progression of her disease. We discussed with Ms Chan-Zindel today that we will discuss her case at our multidisciplinary tumor board tomorrow, and what they recommend. We discussed with Ms Chan-Zindel that if we get the consensus of the tumor board that if they think the mediastinal nodule is  Benign if  we should proceed with the recommended surgery. If the concern is for possible metastasis, then we discussed possible chemoradiation treatment with no surgery or possibly proceeding with a possible left VATS biopsy of this mediastinal nodule and proceed with the recommended surgery to the right lung and SABR to be mediastinal nodule and left lung. We informed Ms Chan-Zindel that we will contact her once her case is discussed at our tumor board with the recommendations. Zulma Olivier had all her questions and concerns addressed at today\\'s visit and agrees with the plan.     Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of Ms Sylvie Chan-Zindel.  Please feel free to contact our office for any questions or concerns.

Stanford Cancer Center  Thoracic Medical Oncology Clinic  Patient Visit    Patient\\'s Name: Derman of Visit: 11/23/2015    Identification: This patient is a 56 Y female with pmhx of latent tuberculosis s/p 6 months of isoniazid 30 years ago with residual lung scarring. Now with multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations (RUL mass- EGFR exon 19 del and RML tumor- EGFR exon 21). On tarceva since 5/15. Here for follow up.     Oncologic History/History of Present Illness: (adapted from prior records)  Summer 2014: Atypical chest pain   11/14: CT scan showed RUL scarring/nodule. Recommended to be followed with serial CTs.  2/15: CT scan did not show significant change but recommended to proceed with biopsy.   02/21/2015: CT guided RUL biopsy showed adenocarcinoma with EGFR exon 19 deletion.  Brain MRI negative for metastases.   03/08/2015: PET-CT scan revealed 3 focal lesions (RUL, RML, LUL).   4/15: CT guided biopsy of LUL showed suspicious cells. (unable to rule out carcinoma)  5/15: Mediastinoscopy negative lymph nodes.   She undergoes attempted resection in Cle Elum  with a partial right middle lobe resection. Ultimately, the surgeon aborts the procedure for unclear reasons at the time. The intention was to do a right middle lobe resection, right upper lobectomy, and to at a later date do a wedge on the left upper lobe suspicious lesion. Pathology on the right middle lobe partial wedge resection demonstrated a separate exon 21 EGFR mutation.   04/28/2015: Started erlotinib 150 mg daily  6/15: Erlotinib dose reduced to 100 mg daily due to skin side effects.  7/15: surveillance chest imaging showed stable disease.   09/06/2015: CT scan- slight decreased opacity in right lung apex, otherwise stable  09/09/2015: Brain MRI- negative for metastases  10/05/2015: initial consult with stanford thoracic oncology  11/15: reviewed case at tumor board. Consensus for surgical resection of RUL and RML and SABR  to LUL lung nodule.   11/14/2015: PET CT- Interval improvement in the RUL mass and opacity at the level of the hilum. New 0.9 x 1.1 cm anterior mediastinal nodule SUV 3.2. Surgery canceled.     Interval History/Review of Systems  Ms. Witherspoon reports disappointment in cancellation of surgery. Eager to start chemotherapy. No change in intermittent cough.   Continuing on tarceva 100 mg daily with skin peeling and fissures on fingertips. Continuing to work full time as a charge nurse.     Here with her supportive husband.     A full 14-point review of systems was performed today. The relevant details are described above with other systems negative.

Findings consistent with known right upper and left upper lobe   malignancies of the lungs, with slight interval decrease in size and   activity in the right upper lobe mass, and relatively stable left   upper lobe passive the when compared to the PET/CT performed on   03/08/2015.  2. New anterior mediastinal nodule with mild hypermetabolic activity,   concerning for metastatic disease.    09/09/2015 Brain MRI- Tower  IMPRESSION   No evidence of intracranial metastasis.    08/10/2015 CT Thorax- Estrada  IMPRESSION   Interval decrease in size of the ill-defined opacity in the right  lung apex compared to previous CT from 01/21/2015. The remainder of  the bilateral lung densities appear unchanged.    No evidence of metastatic disease within the abdomen or pelvis.    Minimal new atelectasis within the right middle lobe.    Severe atrophy of the left kidney again noted. There is moderate  dilatation of the entire left ureter as well as mild dilatation of  the left renal pelvis.    #pul2: Pulmonary nodule for which follow-up CT may be appropriate  depending on the clinical context.    03/08/2015: PET CT- Kaiser  1. ~4.5 x 2.5 x 5.4 cm irregular mixed nodular and groundglass  mass in the right upper lobe with heterogenous mild-to-moderate  FDG activity is the known adenocarcinoma.    2. Faintly or mildly FDG-avid nodular irregular opacity in  the  right upper lobe along the major fissure and additional irregular  mixed nodular and groundglass mass in the left upper lobe abutting  the posteromedial pleural surface are also suspicious for indolent  malignancy such as adenocarcinoma and concerning for multicentric  adenocarcinoma.    3. No obvious FDG-avid lymph nodes in the hilar regions or  mediastinum although sensitivity for detection of metastases in  these regions is decrease given mild metabolism of the primary  lung malignancy.    4. No suspicious FDG uptake in the liver, adrenal glands or  skeleton.    Impression / Plan:     In summary, this patient is a 56 Y female with a pertinent medical history of latent tuberculosis infection status post 6 months of isoniazid completed 30 years ago with the report of residual lung scarring who presents with multi-focal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations including a right upper lobe tumor with an exon 19 lesion and a right middle lobe tumor with an exon 21 mutation. Consensus of thoracic tumor board to proceed with surgical resection of the RUL and RML and SABR to the left lung lesion. Recent PET CT shows a new anterior mediastinal node with decrease in the RUL lesions. After review at the tumor board, consensus was to proceed with systemic chemotherapy to allow for more systemic control before proceeding with surgical resection of the right lung lesions and SABR to the LUL lesion.     We will plan to proceed with carboplatin and pemetrexed next week. She will start a multivitamin with folic acid today and continue daily. She will stop the tarceva 3 days prior to the start of chemotherapy. We will plan to re-image after 2 cycles to assess response and to consider definite treatment.     There is a question if she possibly harbors a germline EGFR mutation (T790M) given her family history and multiple EGFR mutations. We will plan to run molecular testing after her surgery.     She will return on  11/28/2015 to proceed with cycle 1 of carbo/pem.     Plan:  #multiple EGFR mutations (RUL- exon 19 deletion and RML exon 21) with 3 separate primary adenocarcinomas (RUL, RML, and LUL)  -PET CT with new anterior mediastinal nodule  -proceed with carboplatin and pemetrexed. Discontinue erlotinib 3 days prior  -re-image after 2 cycles to assess response to consider surgical resection of right lung lesions and SABR to LUL  -start folic acid 400 mcg daily  -vitamin B12 with cycle 1 then every 9 weeks.   -decadron 4 mg BID the day before and after  -antiemetics sent (zofran, compazine, ativan)  -reviewed chemotherapy teaching sheets.     RTC:  11/28/2015: C1 carboplatin and alimta. (No MD visit)  12/21/2015: labs, clinic visit, consideration of cycle 2 of carbo/pem.      As usual, we encouraged the patient to contact us sooner should she develop any new symptoms or have any questions or concerns.    The patient was seen with Dr. Israel Seaburg, attending physician, who agrees with the above assessment and plan.    Signed,   Fuller, RN, MSN, FNP-C  Stanford Cancer Center  Nurse Practitioner  Thoracic Oncology  Pager 15415    I, Nieves, MD, performed a substantive portion of an E/M visit face-to-face with the same patient on the same date of service with the Advanced Practice Provider (APP).   I was personally involved in reviewing and conducting elements of the history, physical exam and/or medical decision making including the information as described below:  Quintanilla had progression of a single nodule on the left. This changed the plan from surgery and cyberknife to chemotherapy. We did teaching and will plan to start on carbo/pem given the progression on tarceva.  After response we will still plan to pursue radiation and surgery if appropriate.  We had a long discussion about the recent scan and new plan.

Now with multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations (RUL mass- EGFR exon 19 del and RML tumor- EGFR exon 21). On tarceva since 5/15. Here for follow up.     Oncologic History/History of Present Illness: (adapted from prior records)  Summer 2014: Atypical chest pain   11/14: CT scan showed RUL scarring/nodule. Recommended to be followed with serial CTs.  2/15: CT scan did not show significant change but recommended to proceed with biopsy.   02/21/2015: CT guided RUL biopsy showed adenocarcinoma with EGFR exon 19 deletion.  Brain MRI negative for metastases.   03/08/2015: PET-CT scan revealed 3 focal lesions (RUL, RML, LUL).   4/15: CT guided biopsy of LUL showed suspicious cells. (unable to rule out carcinoma)  5/15: Mediastinoscopy negative lymph nodes.   She undergoes attempted resection in Canton  with a partial right middle lobe resection. Ultimately, the surgeon aborts the procedure for unclear reasons at the time. The intention was to do a right middle lobe resection, right upper lobectomy, and to at a later date do a wedge on the left upper lobe suspicious lesion. Pathology on the right middle lobe partial wedge resection demonstrated a separate exon 21 EGFR mutation.   04/28/2015: Started erlotinib 150 mg daily  6/15: Erlotinib dose reduced to 100 mg daily due to skin side effects.  7/15: surveillance chest imaging showed stable disease.   09/06/2015: CT scan- slight decreased opacity in right lung apex, otherwise stable  09/09/2015: Brain MRI- negative for metastases  10/05/2015: initial consult with stanford thoracic oncology  11/15: reviewed case at tumor board. Consensus for surgical resection of RUL and RML and SABR  to LUL lung nodule.   11/14/2015: PET CT- Interval improvement in the RUL mass and opacity at the level of the hilum. New 0.9 x 1.1 cm anterior mediastinal nodule SUV 3.2. Surgery canceled.   11/28/2015: C1 carbo AUC 5, alimta 500 mg/m2  12/21/2015: C2 carbo AUC 5, alimta 500 mg/m2    Interval History/Review of Systems  Ms. Pradhan reports having a tough time on day 3 for nausea. Was in bed with n/v. Did not take zofran or antiemetics. Also found to have hemoptysis and seen by urgent care and found to have pneumonia. Denies fever. Completed course of clarithromycin with improvement. Denies dyspnea or further hemoptysis. Cough and energy are improving. Continuing to work full time. Eating adequately with stable weight. Notes feeling generalized fatigue.     Here with her supportive husband.     A full 14-point review of systems was performed today.

Findings consistent with known right upper and left upper lobe   malignancies of the lungs, with slight interval decrease in size and   activity in the right upper lobe mass, and relatively stable left   upper lobe passive the when compared to the PET/CT performed on   03/08/2015.  2. New anterior mediastinal nodule with mild hypermetabolic activity,   concerning for metastatic disease.    09/09/2015 Brain MRI- Zimmet  IMPRESSION   No evidence of intracranial metastasis.    08/10/2015 CT Thorax- Spangler  IMPRESSION   Interval decrease in size of the ill-defined opacity in the right  lung apex compared to previous CT from 01/21/2015. The remainder of  the bilateral lung densities appear unchanged.    No evidence of metastatic disease within the abdomen or pelvis.    Minimal new atelectasis within the right middle lobe.    Severe atrophy of the left kidney again noted. There is moderate  dilatation of the entire left ureter as well as mild dilatation of  the left renal pelvis.    #pul2: Pulmonary nodule for which follow-up CT may be appropriate  depending on the clinical context.    03/08/2015: PET CT- Kaiser  1. ~4.5 x 2.5 x 5.4 cm irregular mixed nodular and groundglass  mass in the right upper lobe with heterogenous mild-to-moderate  FDG activity is the known adenocarcinoma.    2. Faintly or mildly FDG-avid nodular irregular opacity in the  right upper lobe along the major fissure and additional irregular  mixed nodular and groundglass mass in the left upper lobe abutting  the posteromedial pleural surface are also suspicious for indolent  malignancy such  as adenocarcinoma and concerning for multicentric  adenocarcinoma.    3. No obvious FDG-avid lymph nodes in the hilar regions or  mediastinum although sensitivity for detection of metastases in  these regions is decrease given mild metabolism of the primary  lung malignancy.    4. No suspicious FDG uptake in the liver, adrenal glands or  skeleton.    Impression / Plan:     In summary, this patient is a 56 Y female with a pertinent medical history of latent tuberculosis infection status post 6 months of isoniazid completed 30 years ago with the report of residual lung scarring who presents with multi-focal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations including a right upper lobe tumor with an exon 19 lesion and a right middle lobe tumor with an exon 21 mutation. Consensus of thoracic tumor board to proceed with surgical resection of the RUL and RML and SABR to the left lung lesion. Recent PET CT shows a new anterior mediastinal node with decrease in the RUL lesions. After review at the tumor board, consensus was to proceed with systemic chemotherapy to allow for more systemic control before proceeding with surgical resection of the right lung lesions and SABR to the LUL lesion. She is here prior to cycle 2 of carbo/pem.     Nava had a tough time with nausea and fatigue with cycle 1. I reviewed the antiemetics (zofran, compazine, ativan) which she agrees to do this cycle. Will continue IV emend and aloxi today and hold zofran x 3 days post aloxi.     We will plan to re-image prior to cycle 3 to assess response and to consider definite treatment.     There is a question if she possibly harbors a germline EGFR mutation (T790M) given her family history and multiple EGFR mutations. We will plan to run molecular testing after her surgery.     We discussed a dose reduction but she would like to proceed today. I have instructed her to call if there are any issues or worsening symptoms.     Plan:  #multiple EGFR  mutations (RUL- exon 19 deletion and RML exon 21) with 3 separate primary adenocarcinomas (RUL, RML, and LUL)  -PET CT with new anterior mediastinal nodule  -proceed with cycle 2 carboplatin (AUC 4.5 given decreased creatinine level and patient having hard time) and pemetrexed. Discontinued erlotinib 3 days prior to start of chemo.   -re-image after 2 cycles to assess response to consider surgical resection of right lung lesions and SABR to LUL  -continue folic acid 400 mcg daily  -vitamin B12 with cycle 1 then every 9 weeks.   -decadron 4 mg BID the day before and after  -antiemetics reviewed (zofran, compazine, ativan)    #CINV  -continue IV emend and aloxi  -Start taking zofran day 3 post aloxi, compazine, ativan prn. Call immediately if nausea persists.     #PNA  -now resolved. No further hemoptysis  -completed course of clarithromycin.      RTC in 3 weeks for labs, clinic visit, and consideration of cycle 3 of carbo/pem. CT chest prior.     As usual, I encouraged the patient to contact us sooner should she develop any new symptoms or have any questions or concerns.

The previously noted FDG avid nodule in the anterior mediastinum  is no longer identified.   3.  Chronic atrophic appearance of the left kidney with similar  appearance of multiple wedge-shaped hypodense areas which may  represent infarct or pyelonephritis. Recommend correlation for  infection.    4.  Persistent moderate left hydroureteronephrosis with possible  duplicated collecting system. There is suggestion of a 4.0 x 2.5 cm  mass near the left UVJ. Recommend correlation with cystoscopy to  evaluate for bladder malignancy.   5.  Several punctate hypodense lesions in the liver, too small to  accurately characterize, statistically likely representing cysts.  These were not seen on prior exam, likely due to thick slices on  prior outside imaging. Recommend attention on follow-up.   6.  Mild intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.

COMPARISON: PET/CT dated 11/13/2015 and CT dated 09/06/2015 and 10/16/2014   PROCEDURE COMMENTS: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was  performed following administration of IV contrast. Oral contrast was  not administered prior to the examination.   Dose information: Based on a 32 cm phantom, the estimated radiation  dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam is 9.1, 3.3. The  estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is 651.   FINDINGS:   CHEST:   Medical devices: None.   Thyroid: Normal.   Lymph nodes: Unchanged prominent periaortic lymph node measuring 8 mm  in short axis (series 304, image 104); the previously identified  anterior mediastinal lymph node is no longer identified.   Vasculature: Aorta and main pulmonary artery diameters are within  normal range.   Heart: Mild coronary artery calcifications. Unchanged trace  pericardial effusion.   Lung parenchyma and pleura: No focal consolidation or pleural  effusion. There is mild dependent bibasilar atelectasis. Postsurgical  changes in the right upper lobe appear grossly unchanged. Right upper  lobe mass again seen measuring 4.4 x 1.6 cm, grossly unchanged  (series 304, image 58); satellite nodule in the right upper lobe  along the major fissure with tenting of the fissure measuring 10 x 7  mm, grossly unchanged (series 304, image 94); left upper lobe  pulmonary nodule with surrounding groundglass measuring approximately  3.2 x 2.0 cm with the solid component measuring 1.9 x 0.6 cm, grossly  unchanged (series 304, image 59); 8 mm groundglass pulmonary nodule  in the left upper lobe, unchanged (series 304, image 42); 6 mm  pulmonary nodule in the left upper lobe (image 92), unchanged;  Unchanged 3 mm pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe (series 304,  image 141);   Airways: The central airways are patent.   Chest wall: Normal.   ABDOMEN/PELVIS:   Liver and biliary tree: There are multiple punctate hypodense lesions  in the liver, too small accurately characterize, statistically likely  representing simple cysts. These were not seen on prior imaging,  likely due to differences in technique with thick slices on prior  exams. There is mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.   Gallbladder: Surgically absent. Mild prominence of the common bile  duct to 1 cm which tapers in the pancreatic head.   Spleen: Normal.   Pancreas: Normal.   Adrenal glands: Normal.   Kidneys and ureters: The left kidney again appears small and atrophic  with multiple wedge-shaped areas of hypodensity seen throughout the  parenchyma, possibly representing sites of infection or old infarct.  Persistent moderate left hydronephrosis is noted. Possible duplicated  collecting system on the left with marked dilatation of the distal  left ureter.   There is compensatory hypertrophy of the right kidney there are  numerous punctate hypodense lesion seen in the right kidney, too  small accurately characterize, statistically likely representing  simple cysts. An extrarenal pelvis is noted on the right.   Gastrointestinal tract: The stomach appears grossly unremarkable. The  small and large bowel are normal in caliber.   Peritoneal cavity: Trace free fluid.   Bladder: There is suggestion of a 4.0 x 2.5 cm mass near the  insertion of the left ureter (series 305, image 345).   Uterus and ovaries: Normal.

Now with multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations (RUL mass- EGFR exon 19 del and RML tumor- EGFR exon 21). S/p first line tarceva. Currently on carboplatin and pemetrexed. Here for follow up.     Oncologic History/History of Present Illness: (adapted from prior records)  Summer 2014: Atypical chest pain   11/14: CT scan showed RUL scarring/nodule. Recommended to be followed with serial CTs.  2/15: CT scan did not show significant change but recommended to proceed with biopsy.   02/21/2015: CT guided RUL biopsy showed adenocarcinoma with EGFR exon 19 deletion.  Brain MRI negative for metastases.   03/08/2015: PET-CT scan revealed 3 focal lesions (RUL, RML, LUL).   4/15: CT guided biopsy of LUL showed suspicious cells. (unable to rule out carcinoma)  5/15: Mediastinoscopy negative lymph nodes.   She undergoes attempted resection in Goliad  with a partial right middle lobe resection. Ultimately, the surgeon aborts the procedure for unclear reasons at the time. The intention was to do a right middle lobe resection, right upper lobectomy, and to at a later date do a wedge on the left upper lobe suspicious lesion. Pathology on the right middle lobe partial wedge resection demonstrated a separate exon 21 EGFR mutation.   04/28/2015: Started erlotinib 150 mg daily  6/15: Erlotinib dose reduced to 100 mg daily due to skin side effects.  7/15: surveillance chest imaging showed stable disease.   09/06/2015: CT scan- slight decreased opacity in right lung apex, otherwise stable  09/09/2015: Brain MRI- negative for metastases  10/05/2015: initial consult with stanford thoracic oncology  11/15: reviewed case at tumor board. Consensus for  surgical resection of RUL and RML and SABR to LUL lung nodule.   11/14/2015: PET CT- Interval improvement in the RUL mass and opacity at the level of the hilum. New 0.9 x 1.1 cm anterior mediastinal nodule SUV 3.2. Surgery canceled.   11/28/2015: C1 carbo AUC 5, alimta 500 mg/m2  12/21/2015: C2 carbo AUC 5, alimta 500 mg/m2  12/09/2015: CT CAP: improved anterior mediastinal LN, stable lung masses    Interval History/Review of Systems  Ms. Guber reports continued difficulties with nausea this cycle.  Improved with zofran and compazine, but does not like having to take medications so frequently.  No vomiting.  No further hemoptysis. Cough and energy are improving. Continuing to work full time. Eating adequately with stable weight. Notes feeling generalized fatigue.     Here with her supportive husband.     A full 14-point review of systems was performed today.

Grossly unchanged appearance of the primary right upper and left   upper lobe malignancies. Satellite nodules and scattered groundglass   and solid pulmonary nodules also appear grossly unchanged.  2. The previously noted FDG avid nodule in the anterior mediastinum   is no longer identified.  3. Chronic atrophic appearance of the left kidney with similar   appearance of multiple wedge-shaped hypodense areas which may   represent infarct or pyelonephritis. Recommend correlation for   infection.   4. Persistent moderate left hydroureteronephrosis with possible   duplicated collecting system. There is suggestion of a 4.0 x 2.5 cm   mass near the left UVJ. Recommend correlation with cystoscopy to   evaluate for bladder malignancy.  5. Several punctate hypodense lesions in the liver, too small to   accurately characterize, statistically likely representing cysts.   These were not seen on prior exam, likely due to thick slices on   prior outside imaging. Recommend attention on follow-up.  6. Mild intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.   Recommend correlation with laboratory values to evaluate for biliary   obstruction.    11/13/2015 PET CT  IMPRESSION:  1. Findings consistent with known right upper and left upper lobe   malignancies of the lungs, with slight interval decrease in size and   activity in the right upper lobe mass, and relatively stable left   upper lobe passive the when compared to the PET/CT performed on   03/08/2015.  2. New anterior mediastinal nodule with mild hypermetabolic activity,   concerning for metastatic  disease.    Impression / Plan:     In summary, this patient is a 56 Y female with a pertinent medical history of latent tuberculosis infection status post 6 months of isoniazid completed 30 years ago with the report of residual lung scarring who presents with multi-focal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations including a right upper lobe tumor with an exon 19 lesion and a right middle lobe tumor with an exon 21 mutation. Consensus of thoracic tumor board to proceed with surgical resection of the RUL and RML and SABR to the left lung lesion. Recent PET CT shows a new anterior mediastinal node with decrease in the RUL lesions. After review at the tumor board, consensus was to proceed with systemic chemotherapy to allow for more systemic control before proceeding with surgical resection of the right lung lesions and SABR to the LUL lesion. She is here prior to cycle 3 of carbo/pem with scans showing stable disease overall with improved anterior mediastinal lymph node.       She has continued to have a difficult time with nausea, however it is better controlled with more frequent antiemetic schedule.  Will continue IV emend and aloxi today and hold zofran x 3 days post aloxi.     There is a question if she possibly harbors a germline EGFR mutation (T790M) given her family history and multiple EGFR mutations. We will plan to run molecular testing after her surgery.     Plan:  #multiple EGFR mutations (RUL- exon 19 deletion and RML exon 21) with 3 separate primary adenocarcinomas (RUL, RML, and LUL)  -PET CT with new anterior mediastinal nodule  -proceed with cycle 3 carboplatin AUC 5 and pemetrexed 500mg/m2.   -re-image after 2 cycles to assess response to consider surgical resection of right lung lesions and SABR to LUL  -continue folic acid 400 mcg daily  -vitamin B12 with cycle 1 then every 9 weeks.   -decadron 4 mg BID the day before and after  -antiemetics reviewed (zofran, compazine,  ativan)    #CINV  -continue IV emend and aloxi  -Continue taking zofran day 3 post aloxi, compazine, ativan prn. Call immediately if nausea persists.     RTC in 3 weeks for labs, clinic visit, and consideration of cycle 4 of carbo/pem.    As usual, we encouraged the patient to contact us sooner should she develop any new/worsening symptoms or have any questions or concerns.    The patient was seen concurrently with Dr. Samuel Olivier, attending physician, who agreed with the above assessment and plan.    Signed, 01/11/2016  Drake, MSN, RN, ANP-BC, AOCNP  Nurse Practitioner  Thoracic Oncology  Stanford Cancer Center   Pager: 17182     I, Weintraub, MD, performed a substantive portion of an E/M visit face-to-face with the same patient on the same date of service with the Advanced Practice Provider (APP).   I was personally involved in reviewing and conducting elements of the history, physical exam and/or medical decision making including the information as described below:  Mrs. Gebhart is still have issues with nausea related to her chemotherapy and we discussed options to better control this. She is okay to proceed to C3 and did have some response, though not dramatic.  She will proceed with C3 today of carbo/pem and RTC in 3 weeks.  She has a history of a known bladder cyst and thus asked to postpone cystoscopy as she does not feel that is warranted now.  -Heather Wakelee, MD\\n[2016-03-01 08:48] | STANFORD_OBS/Flowsheet

Now with multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations (RUL mass- EGFR exon 19 del and RML tumor- EGFR exon 21). S/p first line tarceva. Currently on carboplatin and pemetrexed. Here for follow up.     Oncologic History/History of Present Illness: (adapted from prior records)  Summer 2014: Atypical chest pain   11/14: CT scan showed RUL scarring/nodule. Recommended to be followed with serial CTs.  2/15: CT scan did not show significant change but recommended to proceed with biopsy.   02/21/2015: CT guided RUL biopsy showed adenocarcinoma with EGFR exon 19 deletion.  Brain MRI negative for metastases.   03/08/2015: PET-CT scan revealed 3 focal lesions (RUL, RML, LUL).   4/15: CT guided biopsy of LUL showed suspicious cells. (unable to rule out carcinoma)  5/15: Mediastinoscopy negative lymph nodes.   She undergoes attempted resection in Kailua  with a partial right middle lobe resection. Ultimately, the surgeon aborts the procedure for unclear reasons at the time. The intention was to do a right middle lobe resection, right upper lobectomy, and to at a later date do a wedge on the left upper lobe suspicious lesion. Pathology on the right middle lobe partial wedge resection demonstrated a separate exon 21 EGFR mutation.   04/28/2015: Started erlotinib 150 mg daily  6/15: Erlotinib dose reduced to 100 mg daily due to skin side effects.  7/15: surveillance chest imaging showed stable disease.   09/06/2015: CT scan- slight decreased opacity in right lung apex, otherwise stable  09/09/2015: Brain MRI- negative for metastases  10/05/2015: initial consult with stanford thoracic oncology  11/15: reviewed case at tumor board. Consensus for  surgical resection of RUL and RML and SABR to LUL lung nodule.   11/14/2015: PET CT- Interval improvement in the RUL mass and opacity at the level of the hilum. New 0.9 x 1.1 cm anterior mediastinal nodule SUV 3.2. Surgery canceled.   11/28/2015: C1 carbo AUC 5, alimta 500 mg/m2  12/21/2015: C2 carbo AUC 5, alimta 500 mg/m2  01/09/2016: CT CAP: improved anterior mediastinal LN, stable lung masses  01/12/2016: C3 carbo, alimta  02/02/2016: C4 carbo, alimta    Interval History/Review of Systems  Ms. Borchardt reports continued nausea. Worse after day 3. Using zofran and compazine but finds less effective. Dislikes taking medications frequently. Has not tried ativan. Notes more fatigue. Continuing to try to work full time.

Grossly unchanged appearance of the primary right upper and left   upper lobe malignancies. Satellite nodules and scattered groundglass   and solid pulmonary nodules also appear grossly unchanged.  2. The previously noted FDG avid nodule in the anterior mediastinum   is no longer identified.  3. Chronic atrophic appearance of the left kidney with similar   appearance of multiple wedge-shaped hypodense areas which may   represent infarct or pyelonephritis. Recommend correlation for   infection.   4. Persistent moderate left hydroureteronephrosis with possible   duplicated collecting system. There is suggestion of a 4.0 x 2.5 cm   mass near the left UVJ. Recommend correlation with cystoscopy to   evaluate for bladder malignancy.  5. Several punctate hypodense lesions in the liver, too small to   accurately characterize, statistically likely representing cysts.   These were not seen on prior exam, likely due to thick slices on   prior outside imaging. Recommend attention on follow-up.  6. Mild intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.   Recommend correlation with laboratory values to evaluate for biliary   obstruction.    11/13/2015 PET CT  IMPRESSION:  1. Findings consistent with known right upper and left upper lobe   malignancies of the lungs, with slight interval decrease in size and   activity in the right upper lobe  mass, and relatively stable left   upper lobe passive the when compared to the PET/CT performed on   03/08/2015.  2. New anterior mediastinal nodule with mild hypermetabolic activity,   concerning for metastatic disease.    Impression / Plan:     In summary, this patient is a 56 Y female with a pertinent medical history of latent tuberculosis infection status post 6 months of isoniazid completed 30 years ago with the report of residual lung scarring who presents with multi-focal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations including a right upper lobe tumor with an exon 19 lesion and a right middle lobe tumor with an exon 21 mutation. Consensus of thoracic tumor board to proceed with surgical resection of the RUL and RML and SABR to the left lung lesion. Recent PET CT shows a new anterior mediastinal node with decrease in the RUL lesions. After review at the tumor board, consensus was to proceed with systemic chemotherapy to allow for more systemic control before proceeding with surgical resection of the right lung lesions and SABR to the LUL lesion. She is here prior to cycle 4 of carbo/pem with most recent scans showing stable disease overall with improved anterior mediastinal lymph node.       Nausea continues to be an issue. Will continue with aloxi and IV emend today. Encouraged more frequent use of compazine and to try ativan tonight to allow for more control early on. She will proceed with cycle 4 of carbo and alimta and return in 3.5 weeks prior to cycle 5 with new imaging.     There is a question if she possibly harbors a germline EGFR mutation (T790M) given her family history and multiple EGFR mutations. We will plan to run molecular testing after her surgery.     Plan:  #multiple EGFR mutations (RUL- exon 19 deletion and RML exon 21) with 3 separate primary adenocarcinomas (RUL, RML, and LUL)  -PET CT with new anterior mediastinal nodule  -proceed with cycle 4 carboplatin AUC 5 and pemetrexed 500mg/m2.    -re-image prior to next cycle to assess response to consider surgical resection of right lung lesions and SABR to LUL  -continue folic acid 400 mcg daily  -vitamin B12 with cycle 4 then every 9 weeks.   -decadron 4 mg BID the day before and after  -antiemetics reviewed (zofran, compazine, ativan)    #CINV  -continue IV emend and aloxi  -Continue taking zofran day 3 post aloxi, compazine, ativan prn. Call immediately if nausea persists.   -ativan tonight then every 4 hrs as needed.     RTC in 3 weeks for labs, clinic visit, and consideration of cycle 5 of carbo/pem. CT scan prior.     As usual, I encouraged the patient to contact us sooner should she develop any new symptoms or have any questions or concerns.

A copy of my consult note is attached below. We did a cystoscopy and she has a ureterocele from her left ureter - this is a benign malformation that is most likely congenital, and does not require treatment.  She does get recurrent UTIs but I don\\'t think that is related.  She is managing those with on-demand antibiotics which is working well - I told her if they become more problematic she might consider daily suppression with 50 mg nitrofurantoin.         Thank you so much for the opportunity to see this nice patient.   Please call if you have any questions about my recommendations.

She has been on mutiple regiments of chemotherapy followed here at stanford and is currently on carboplatin and pemetrexed for her lung masses.  Her most recent CT CAP on 01/08/2016 showed improved mediastinal LN and stable lung masses.  However it did show persistent moderate L hydroureteronephrosis and possibly duplicated system.  There was suggestion of a 4x2.5 cm mass near the L UVJ.  The patient was thus referred here for possible cystoscopy.     Regarding her urologic history, she has had recurrent UTI\\'s since her childhood. She was also noted on ultrasound during her pregnancy and noted to have atrophic L kidney about 25 years ago.  She had a cystoscopy done, and was told that she had \"cyst\" at the entry of the ureter into bladder. She thinks it was a ureterocele.    LUTS: DTF q6-7h, NTFx0, Endorses no urge, no UUI, no SUI, no pads/diapers, No hx of incomplete emptying, normal stream, no straining, no hesticancy, no hematuria, no hx of stones, she uses prn antibiotics at onset of UTI, she thinks she\\'s having them every 3-4 months.

She has a known history of L ureterocele 25 years ago and L atrophic kidney on recent imaging found to have stable moderate hydro of that L kidney, and possible bladder mass.  She has had recurrent UTI\\'s since childhood and is happy with her current status using prn antibiotics at onset of symptoms which has been working well. Cysto today confirmed a large L ureterocele without any evidence of atypia.  We discussed incision of the ureterocele this to prevent infections if they become more persistent or severe, but we could risk potentially allowing reflux, especially given she is content with her current status.    Recommendation   - No further work up or therapy for ureterocele  - If worsening UTI/infections can discuss incision in future  - RTC prn     Remy Lamberts, MD  Urologic Surgery PGY-5  Stanford Hospitals & Clinics  Pager 12460     Teaching Physician Attestation   I saw and examined the patient and discussed management with the resident.  I discussed our findings, assessment and plan in detail with the patient and family present.  I reviewed the resident/fellow\\'s note above, amended it as written, and agree with the documented  findings, assessment, and plan. She clearly has a ureterocele that is most likely congenital.  I don\\'t think doing anything for the ureterocele is going to affect the frequency of her UTIs.        For now the PRN antibiotics seems like a good answer.

FINDINGS: Urethra - normal  Bladder - large bladder, no evidence of recurrent infections, large L ureterocele raising up the entire trigone on that side and swelling extending to the ureteral orifice which is otherwise orthotopic in nature.  Her R UO was orthotopic and had clear urine efflux.  Vaginal exam - no masses, non tender, alight atrophy      PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was given antibiotics prior to the initiation of the procedure.  A Time-Out was performed immediately prior to the procedure to confirm correct patient, procedure, and site.   The patient was in the dorsal lithotomy position, and was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Mulka was then performed, with the findings as noted above. Upon completion of the procedure, she was discharged home with the appropriate instructions, having tolerated the procedure well.      Assessment: 56 Y female with L ureterocele, no evidence of bladder mass or tumor.  Plan: RTC prn in future, possible ureterocele incision if recurrent or worsening infections.

to our urology clinic by Lyman Kile, Seymour Hillman* regarding a new \"bladder mass\"    HPI: she is a 56 Y F with hx of multifocal adenocarcinoma of lung diagnosed in 10/22/2014 with multiple EGFR mutations s/p resection of one of the masses back on 04/21/2015.  She has been on mutiple regiments of chemotherapy followed here at stanford and is currently on carboplatin and pemetrexed for her lung masses.  Her most recent CT CAP on 01/08/2016 showed improved mediastinal LN and stable lung masses.  However it did show persistent moderate L hydroureteronephrosis and possibly duplicated system.  There was suggestion of a 4x2.5 cm mass near the L UVJ.  The patient was thus referred here for possible cystoscopy.     Regarding her urologic history, she has had recurrent UTI\\'s since her childhood. She was also noted on ultrasound during her pregnancy and noted to have atrophic L kidney about 25 years ago.  She had a cystoscopy done, and was told that she had \"cyst\" at the entry of the ureter into bladder. She thinks it was a ureterocele.    LUTS: DTF q6-7h, NTFx0, Endorses no urge, no UUI, no SUI, no pads/diapers, No hx of incomplete emptying, normal stream, no straining, no hesticancy, no hematuria, no hx of stones, she uses prn antibiotics at onset of UTI, she thinks she\\'s having them every 3-4 months. Sexually active.     ROS: The patient filled out a 14 point system review which was filed in the chart.   GENERAL: No weight loss or constitutional complaints. Some fatigue, but improving  HEENT: There is no dysphasia or nose or throat problems.   CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: no current chest pain, shortness of breath, rapid heart beat.

Satellite nodules and scattered groundglass   and solid pulmonary nodules also  appear grossly unchanged.   2. The previously noted FDG avid nodule in the anterior mediastinum   is no longer identified.   3. Chronic atrophic appearance of the left kidney with similar  appearance of multiple wedge-shaped hypodense areas which may  represent infarct or pyelonephritis. Recommend correlation for  infection.   4. Persistent moderate left hydroureteronephrosis with possible  duplicated collecting system. There is suggestion of a 4.0 x 2.5 cm mass near the left UVJ. Recommend correlation with cystoscopy to evaluate for bladder malignancy.   5. Several punctate hypodense lesions in the liver, too small to accurately characterize, statistically likely representing cysts. These were not seen on prior exam, likely due to thick slices on prior outside imaging. Recommend attention on follow-up.   6. Mild intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Recommend correlation with laboratory values to evaluate for biliary bstruction.      Assessment  56F with lung cancer currently stable disease on chemotherapy.  She has a known history of L ureterocele 25 years ago and L atrophic kidney on recent imaging found to have stable moderate hydro of that L kidney, and possible bladder mass.  She has had recurrent UTI\\'s since childhood and is happy with her current status using prn antibiotics at onset of symptoms which has been working well. Cysto today confirmed a large L ureterocele without any evidence of atypia.  We discussed incision of the ureterocele this to prevent infections if they become more persistent or severe, but we could risk potentially allowing reflux, especially given she is content with her current status.    Recommendation   - No further work up or therapy for ureterocele  - If worsening UTI/infections can discuss incision in future  - RTC prn     Remy Lamberts, MD  Urologic Surgery PGY-5  Stanford Hospitals & Clinics  Pager 12460     Teaching Physician Attestation   I saw and examined  the patient and discussed management with the resident.  I discussed our findings, assessment and plan in detail with the patient and family present.  I reviewed the resident/fellow\\'s note above, amended it as written, and agree with the documented findings, assessment, and plan. She clearly has a ureterocele that is most likely congenital.  I don\\'t think doing anything for the ureterocele is going to affect the frequency of her UTIs.        For now the PRN antibiotics seems like a good answer.

FINDINGS: Urethra - normal  Bladder - large bladder, no evidence of recurrent infections, large L ureterocele raising up the entire trigone on that side and swelling extending to the ureteral orifice which is otherwise orthotopic in nature.  Her R UO was orthotopic and had clear urine efflux.  Vaginal exam - no masses, non tender, alight atrophy      PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was given antibiotics prior to the initiation of the procedure.  A Time-Out was performed immediately prior to the procedure to confirm correct patient, procedure, and site.   The patient was in the dorsal lithotomy position, and was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Osmundson was then performed, with the findings as noted above. Upon completion of the procedure, she was discharged home with the appropriate instructions, having tolerated the procedure well.      Assessment: 56 Y female with L ureterocele, no evidence of bladder mass or tumor.  Plan: RTC prn in future, possible ureterocele incision if recurrent or worsening infections.

As you know, Ms. Zechariah Tierney is a pleasant 56-year-old female with a past medical history of latent tuberculosis, status post 6 months of isoniazid 30 years ago with residual lung scarring. Now with multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations(right upper lobe mass EGFR exon 19 DL and right middle lobe tumor EGFR exon 21). Status post first line Tarceva, currently on carboplatin and pemetrexed. She returns back to our thoracic surgery clinic for consideration of surgical resection of the right upper lobe and right middle lobe tumor, after completing 4 cycles of carbo/pem, where most recent scan shows stable disease overall, with improved anterior mediastinal lymph node. \\xa0      On today\\'s visit, Ms. Vignes continues to overall be feeling well.    She did report some nausea, which seems worse from cycle to cycle, and is using Zofran and Compazine, but at times  less effective. She reports her appetite is fair. Otherwise she denies any fever, chills, night sweats, dyspnea on exertion, chest pain, shortness of breath, or bony pains or any neurological changes.    She also continues to note some more fatigue, but continues to work full time as a registered nurse.     A 14-point review of system was performed today. The relevant details are described above, with all other systems negative.     On physical exam, current vital signs, blood pressure 121/80, pulse 91, respirations 16, temp 98.3, O2 saturation 98% on room air. Current weight 62.1 kg. General Appearance: Well nourished, in no acute distress. Head: Normocephalic. Eyes: Extraocular movements intact. Pupils reactive. Neck: Supple. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs rubs or gallops noted.    Respiratory: Clear to auscultation and palpation bilaterally.    Abdomen: Soft, normoactive bowel sounds. Nontender, nondistended No palpable hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Extremities: Warm, and well perfused. No edema. Neuro: She is alert and oriented. Cranial nerves intact. Otherwise nonfocal exam throughout. Gait unremarkable. Lymph nodes: No palpable adenopathy along cervical, or clavicular, or axillary chains. Skin: Warm, dry and intact. No rashes.     Imaging reviewed in clinic.     CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed on 02/20/2016, was reviewed in clinic today, shows re-demonstration of postsurgical changes, right upper lobe mass similar to prior, measuring 4.4 x 1.5 cm. Previously 4.4 x 1.6 cm. A satellite nodule in the right upper lobe along the major fissure, also without significant interval change, measuring 9 x 6 mm, previously 10 x 7 mm. There is grossly unchanged left upper lobe solid and ground-glass opacities, measuring 2.9 x 2.0 cm, previously 3.2 x 2.0 cm. Additional ground-glass and solid pulmonary nodules in the left upper lobe are unchanged, measuring 8 mm and 6 mm,  respectively. A 3 mm nodule in the right lower lobe is also unchanged. No definitely new pulmonary nodules visualized. No new focal consolidation or pleural effusion. There is a stable prominent periaortic lymph node, measuring 8 mm in short axis diameter. There is no supraclavicular, axillary or mediastinal hilar lymphadenopathy.     Impression And Plan: In summary, Ms. Sarai Reis is a 56-year-old female with a pertinent medical history of latent tuberculosis infection, status post 6 months isoniazid, completed 30 years ago, with a report residual lung scar, who presents with multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations, including a right upper lobe tumor with an exon 19 lesion, and a right middle lobe tumor with an exon 21 mutation. Consensus of the thoracic tumor board is to proceed with surgical resection of the right upper lobe and right middle lobe and SABR to the left lung lesion. Recent PET-CT shows a new anterior mediastinal mass with decrease in the right upper lobe lesion. After review of the tumor board, consensus was proceed with systemic chemotherapy to allow pharmaceutic control before proceeding with surgical resection of the right lung lesions and SABR to the left upper lobe lesion. She has received 4 cycles of carbo/pem, with most recent scan showing stable disease overall with improved anterior mediastinal lymph node. Dr. Akbar reviewed all images and information with Ms. Soin and her husband at today\\'s visit and recommends she undergo a flexible bronchoscopy, right thoracotomy, right upper and right middle lobectomy. Ms. Reis gave informed consent for the procedure after discussion of the risks and benefits, during which the patient and her husband had an opportunity to ask questions and have them answered to their satisfaction. Risks discussed included bleeding, infection, prolonged air leak, arrhythmia, pneumonia, and death. Surgery is planned for 03/21/2016. She will  undergo her preoperative lab work after her visit with us today, we will have her undergo a repeat PET Scan prior to surgery. Surgical consent was obtained at today\\'s visit. Ms. Reis and her husband had all their questions and concerns addressed at today\\'s visit and agree with the plan.      Thank you for involving us in the care of this nice lady. Please do not hesitate to contact our office if you any questions or concerns.           Sincerely,     Henry Gustafson, NP    I, Avery Osborn, MD, personally saw the patient and performed a substantive portion of this E/M visit face-to-face with the same patient on the same date of service with the Advanced Practice Provider (APP). I was personally involved in reviewing and conducting elements of the history, physical exam, radiographic and/or laboratory studies, and/or medical decision making, and I agree with and edited the above document where appropriate.      Given the prior history of mediastinoscopy, this will not be repeated, however repeat PET will be used to restage her mediastinum.

Identification: This patient is a 56 Y female with pmhx of latent tuberculosis s/p 6 months of isoniazid 30 years ago with residual lung scarring. Now with multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations (RUL mass- EGFR exon 19 del and RML tumor- EGFR exon 21). S/p first line tarceva. Currently on carboplatin and pemetrexed. Here for follow up.     Oncologic History/History of Present Illness: (adapted from prior records)  Summer 2014: Atypical chest pain   11/14: CT scan showed RUL scarring/nodule. Recommended to be followed with serial CTs.  2/15: CT scan did not show significant change but recommended to proceed with biopsy.   02/21/2015: CT guided RUL biopsy showed adenocarcinoma with EGFR exon 19 deletion.  Brain MRI negative for metastases.   03/08/2015: PET-CT scan revealed 3 focal lesions (RUL, RML, LUL).   4/15: CT guided biopsy of LUL showed suspicious cells. (unable to rule out carcinoma)  5/15: Mediastinoscopy negative lymph nodes.   She undergoes attempted resection in Bonifay  with a partial right middle lobe resection. Ultimately, the surgeon aborts the procedure for unclear reasons at the time. The intention was to do a right middle lobe resection, right upper lobectomy, and to at a later date do a wedge on the left upper lobe suspicious lesion. Pathology on the right middle lobe partial wedge resection demonstrated a separate exon 21 EGFR mutation.   04/28/2015: Started erlotinib 150 mg daily  6/15: Erlotinib dose reduced to 100 mg daily due to skin side effects.  7/15: surveillance chest imaging showed stable disease.   09/06/2015: CT scan- slight decreased opacity in right lung apex, otherwise stable  09/09/2015: Brain MRI- negative for metastases  10/05/2015: initial consult with stanford thoracic oncology  11/15: reviewed case at tumor board. Consensus for  surgical resection of RUL and RML and SABR to LUL lung nodule.   11/14/2015: PET CT- Interval improvement in the RUL mass and opacity at the level of the hilum. New 0.9 x 1.1 cm anterior mediastinal nodule SUV 3.2. Surgery canceled.   11/28/2015: C1 carbo AUC 5, alimta 500 mg/m2  12/21/2015: C2 carbo AUC 5, alimta 500 mg/m2  01/09/2016: CT CAP: improved anterior mediastinal LN, stable lung masses  01/12/2016: C3 carbo, alimta  02/02/2016: C4 carbo, alimta  02/20/2016: CT CAP: stable disease    Interval History/Review of Systems  Ms. Shirvani reports continued nausea is primary issue.  Worst for the first few days after chemo and then gradually better.  Able to work full time with taking just a few days off after chemo.  Wants to review some older imaging reports as she has been thinking about the time prior to her diagnosis.  Still wishes to be as aggressive in her care as is reasonable.      Here with her supportive husband.     A full 14-point review of systems was performed today. The relevant details are described above with other systems negative.

Impression / Plan:     In summary, this patient is a 56 Y female with a pertinent medical history of latent tuberculosis infection status post 6 months of isoniazid completed 30 years ago with the report of residual lung scarring who presents with multi-focal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations including a right upper lobe tumor with an exon 19 lesion and a right middle lobe tumor with an exon 21 mutation. Consensus of thoracic tumor board to proceed with surgical resection of the RUL and RML and SABR to the left lung lesion. Recent PET CT showed a new anterior mediastinal node with decrease in the RUL lesions. After review at the tumor board, consensus was to proceed with systemic chemotherapy to allow for more systemic control  before proceeding with surgical resection of the right lung lesions and SABR to the LUL lesion. Follow up scans after 2 cycles showed improved anterior mediastinal lymph node and she presents today after 4 cycles with scans showing stable disease.    We have reviewed her imaging with Dr. Liang and we are in agreement that she can proceed to surgery for the right upper and middle lobe bilobectomy.  We will plan for SABR to the left lesion after surgery.  She will stop chemotherapy at this time.    There is a question if she possibly harbors a germline EGFR mutation (T790M) given her family history and multiple EGFR mutations. We will plan to run molecular testing after her surgery.     Plan:  #multiple EGFR mutations (RUL- exon 19 deletion and RML exon 21) with 3 separate primary adenocarcinomas (RUL, RML, and LUL)  -PET CT with new anterior mediastinal nodule, which decreased with chemotherapy  -s/p cycle 4 carboplatin AUC 5 and pemetrexed 500mg/m2.   -surgery with Dr. Garza for bilobectomy scheduled for 4/14  - plan for SABR to LUL after surgery    #CINV  -had significant and prolonged nausea  -expect to fully resolve off chemotherapy     RTC for joint post-op appt with Dr. Paik 2 weeks after surgery.    As usual, we encouraged the patient to contact us sooner should she develop any new/worsening symptoms or have any questions or concerns.    The patient was seen concurrently with Dr. Lucas Lipinski, attending physician, who agreed with the above assessment and plan.    Signed, 02/26/2016  Borawski, MSN, RN, ANP-BC, AOCNP  Nurse Practitioner  Thoracic Oncology  Stanford Cancer Center   Pager: 17182    I, Zehr, MD, performed a substantive portion of an E/M visit face-to-face with the same patient on the same date of service with the Advanced Practice Provider (APP).   I was personally involved in reviewing and conducting elements of the history, physical exam and/or medical decision  making including the information as described below:  We discussed options in detail after the completion of erlotinib with some response and 4 cycles of carbo/pem with some response and persistent lung cancers (3 separate primaries with different EGFR mutations).  At this time we will proceed to surgery though she understands that the likelihood of recurrence is high and that we may find more extensive disease.  Case discussed with Dr. Robinson who also saw the patient today.  Will not give further systemic therapy at this time unless more extensive disease is found at time of resection. Will do additional mutational analysis at time of surgery.  -Heather Wakelee, MD\\n[2016-04-16 16:19] | STANFORD_NOTE/progress-notes | NOTE: Patient came to ITA for labs and PIV placement.

Dr Ste 589 I10 Svc Rd, Roosevelt TX      RE: Krishna, Tonia   MRN: [000000]   DOB: 03/04/1959     Dear Colleagues,     We had the pleasure of seeing Tonia Krishna in our thoracic surgery clinic at Stanford Cancer Center today for a followup visit.     As you know, Ms. Ramiro Tierney is a pleasant 56-year-old female with a past medical history of latent tuberculosis, status post 6 months of isoniazid 30 years ago with residual lung scarring. Now with multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations(right upper lobe mass EGFR exon 19 DL and right middle lobe tumor EGFR exon 21). Status post first line Tarceva, currently on carboplatin and pemetrexed. She returns back to our thoracic surgery clinic for consideration of surgical resection of the right upper lobe and right middle lobe tumor, after completing 4 cycles of carbo/pem, where most recent scan shows stable disease overall, with improved anterior mediastinal lymph node.   On today\\'s visit, Ms. Ten continues to overall be feeling well. She did report some nausea, which seems worse from cycle to cycle, and is using Zofran and Compazine, but at times less effective. She reports her appetite is fair. Otherwise she denies any fever, chills, night sweats, dyspnea on exertion, chest pain, shortness of breath, or bony pains or any neurological changes. She also continues to note some more fatigue, but continues to work full time as a registered nurse.     A 14-point review of system was performed today. The relevant details are described above, with all other systems negative.     On physical exam, current vital signs, blood pressure 121/80, pulse 91, respirations 16, temp 98.3, O2 saturation 98% on room air.  Current weight 62.1 kg. General Appearance: Well nourished, in no acute distress. Head: Normocephalic. Eyes: Extraocular movements intact. Pupils reactive. Neck: Supple. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs rubs or gallops noted. Respiratory: Clear to auscultation and palpation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft, normoactive bowel sounds. Nontender, nondistended No palpable hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Extremities: Warm, and well perfused. No edema. Neuro: She is alert and oriented. Cranial nerves intact. Otherwise nonfocal exam throughout. Gait unremarkable. Lymph nodes: No palpable adenopathy along cervical, or clavicular, or axillary chains. Skin: Warm, dry and intact. No rashes.     Imaging reviewed in clinic.     CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed on 02/20/2016, was reviewed in clinic today, shows re-demonstration of postsurgical changes, right upper lobe mass similar to prior, measuring 4.4 x 1.5 cm. Previously 4.4 x 1.6 cm. A satellite nodule in the right upper lobe along the major fissure, also without significant interval change, measuring 9 x 6 mm, previously 10 x 7 mm. There is grossly unchanged left upper lobe solid and ground-glass opacities, measuring 2.9 x 2.0 cm, previously 3.2 x 2.0 cm. Additional ground-glass and solid pulmonary nodules in the left upper lobe are unchanged, measuring 8 mm and 6 mm, respectively. A 3 mm nodule in the right lower lobe is also unchanged. No definitely new pulmonary nodules visualized. No new focal consolidation or pleural effusion. There is a stable prominent periaortic lymph node, measuring 8 mm in short axis diameter. There is no supraclavicular, axillary or mediastinal hilar lymphadenopathy.     Impression And Plan: In summary, Ms. Tonia Krishna is a 56-year-old female with a pertinent medical history of latent tuberculosis infection, status post 6 months isoniazid, completed 30 years ago, with a report residual lung scar, who presents with  multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations, including a right upper lobe tumor with an exon 19 lesion, and a right middle lobe tumor with an exon 21 mutation. Consensus of the thoracic tumor board is to proceed with surgical resection of the right upper lobe and right middle lobe and SABR to the left lung lesion. Recent PET-CT shows a new anterior mediastinal mass with decrease in the right upper lobe lesion. After review of the tumor board, consensus was proceed with systemic chemotherapy to allow pharmaceutic control before proceeding with surgical resection of the right lung lesions and SABR to the left upper lobe lesion. She has received 4 cycles of carbo/pem, with most recent scan showing stable disease overall with improved anterior mediastinal lymph node. Dr. Kleinman reviewed all images and information with Ms. Taneja and her husband at today\\'s visit and recommends she undergo a flexible bronchoscopy, right thoracotomy, right upper and right middle lobectomy. Ms. Warburton gave informed consent for the procedure after discussion of the risks and benefits, during which the patient and her husband had an opportunity to ask questions and have them answered to their satisfaction. Risks discussed included bleeding, infection, prolonged air leak, arrhythmia, pneumonia, and death. Surgery is planned for 03/21/2016. She will undergo her preoperative lab work after her visit with us today, we will have her undergo a repeat PET Scan prior to surgery. Surgical consent was obtained at today\\'s visit. Ms. Krishna and her husband had all their questions and concerns addressed at today\\'s visit and agree with the plan.      Thank you for involving us in the care of this nice lady. Please do not hesitate to contact our office if you any questions or concerns.     Sincerely,       Melvin Clough, NP      I, Ryder Laventure, MD, personally saw the patient and performed a substantive portion of this E/M visit  face-to-face with the same patient on the same date of service with the Advanced Practice Provider (APP). I was personally involved in reviewing and conducting elements of the history, physical exam, radiographic and/or laboratory studies, and/or medical decision making, and I agree with and edited the above document where appropriate. Given the prior history of mediastinoscopy, this will not be repeated, however repeat PET will be used to restage her mediastinum.

Mild interval enlargement of a right upper lobe mass reflecting  mild progressive disease when compared to the PET/CT performed  11/13/2015.  No new FDG avid nodules.  No new FDG avid lymphadenopathy. 2. Grossly unchanged subsolid nodule in the left upper lobe. I have personally reviewed the images for this examination and agree with the report transcribed above. WHOLE-BODY F-18 FDG PET-CT: 03/11/2016   CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 years of age, Female, with history of latent TB  infection, status post 6 month isoniazid completed 30 years ago, now  with multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations,  status post 3 cycles of chemotherapy, scheduled for right upper and  middle lobectomy 03/21/2016. The patient is referred for evaluation of  response to therapy.   COMPARISON: FDG PET/CT 11/13/2015   PROCEDURE COMMENTS:  Tracer information: Measured (injected) dose: 11.6 mCi. Injection site: Right antecubital.   Imaging information, imaging parameters, and additional medications: Anatomical region: The area imaged included the skull base to mid  thigh. Lasix: None. Oral contrast: None. IV contrast: None.   CT dose information: Based on a 32 cm phantom, the estimated  radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam is 2.12.  The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is 191.11.   Scan technique: Following IV administration of the  radiopharmaceutical, images were acquired using the GE model 710  PET-CT scanner. A low-dose CT scan was performed for attenuation  correction and anatomic correlation only. If a comprehensive  diagnostic CT is required, the Department of Radiology should be  consulted for an adjunct CT study. Images were reconstructed and  reviewed in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. For descriptive  purposes, the maximum standard uptake value (SUV max) of  metabolically active tissues is reported in g/mL, unless stated  otherwise.   Baseline measurements: Current mean liver SUV: 2.7 g/mL. Prior mean liver SUV: 2.4 g/mL. Current mean gluteal muscle SUV: 0.6 g/mL. Prior mean gluteal muscle SUV: 0.5 g/mL.   FINDINGS:   Head and neck: Limited evaluation of the brain demonstrates intense  FDG uptake in the visualized cerebral cortex gray matter. This high  physiologic background activity reduces the sensitivity of PET for  malignant processes. Physiologic FDG uptake is seen in the ocular  muscles, salivary glands, oropharynx, and vocal cords. There are no  pathologically enlarged cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes. The  thyroid gland is unremarkable.   Thorax: The right apical mass with adjacent spiculation now measures  1.6 x 4.4 cm, SUV 3.0, image 63 (previously measuring 4.0 x 1.5 cm,  SUV 2.0). There is a right upper lobe 0.9 cm nodule (image 76) which  is unchanged when compared to the prior. In the left upper lobe there  is a 2.0 x 2.0 cm nodule, which is grossly stable when compared to  the prior study, current SUV 2.1 (previously 2.1 x 2.1 cm SUV 1.8).  Surgical resection sutures are present in the right middle lobe. Physiologic FDG uptake is present in the myocardium. There is no  pleural or pericardial effusion. The thoracic aorta and main  pulmonary artery are normal in caliber. There are no pathologically  enlarged or hypermetabolic axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph  nodes.   Abdomen and pelvis: Physiologic FDG uptake is present in the liver,  spleen, and bowel. Clips are present in the gallbladder fossa  consistent with prior cholecystectomy. The adrenal glands and  pancreas are unremarkable on the non-contrast CT. There is marked  atrophy of the left kidney, with likely compensatory hypertrophy of  the right kidney.  The ureters, and urinary bladder are visualized  per clearance of the radiotracer. Intense signal from excreted tracer  limits evaluation for malignancy in the urinary tract. The abdominal  aorta is normal in caliber. There are no pathologically enlarged or  hypermetabolic abdominal, pelvic, or inguinal lymph nodes.   Musculoskeletal: Physiologic FDG uptake is present in the axial and  proximal appendicular skeleton. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic  osseous lesions are visualized on the CT.\\n[2016-04-30 23:59] | STANFORD_VISIT_DETAIL/Radiology\\n[2016-04-30 23:59] | STANFORD_VISIT_DETAIL/Radiology\\n[2016-05-01 00:00] | CMS Place of Service/02 (Telehealth)\\n[2016-05-01 11:15] | STANFORD_NOTE/telephone-encounter | NOTE: Call to Zinnia as she was requesting update on her most recent imaging.

Code Status   Full Code    ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  Savanah Zimmermann is a 57 Y old female with a history of LUNG CANCER, ureterocele, atrophy of left kidney, underwent R thoracotomy for lobectomy of RML and RUL.    She has moderate pain control on the current pain regimen, improved after bupi bolus.     Accordingly, the pain management plan is:  1. Continue Bupi 1/8% at 6 cc/hr through epidural  2. Stopped Dilaudid 0.05 mg/hr through epidural 2/2 to nausea  3. Continue Fentanyl PCEA to 10mcg Q10 min lockout. If need to continue to bolus, will consider switching to bupi-fentanyl PCEA.    Thank you. We will continue to follow. Please feel free to page me with questions.

She has moderate pain control on the current pain regimen, complicated by nausea.     Accordingly, the pain management plan is:  1. Continue Bupi 1/8% at 8 cc/hr through epidural  2. Consider adding scopolamine patch to antinausea regimen  3. DC epidural on PO day 5  or when taking POs comfortably which ever is earlier    Thank you. We will continue to follow. Please feel free to page me with questions.

When an entire lung is removed, the procedure is called a pneumonectomy. When only part of a lung is removed, the procedure is called a lobectomy. A lung resection is typically done to get rid of a tumor or cancer, but it may be done to treat other conditions. This procedure can help relieve some or all of your symptoms and can also help keep the problem from getting worse. Lung resection may provide the best chance for curing your disease. However, the procedure may not necessarily cure lung cancer if that is the problem.   LET YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER KNOW ABOUT:   · Any allergies you have.  · All medicines you are taking, including vitamins, herbs, eye drops, creams, and over-the-counter medicines.  · Previous problems you or members of your family have had with the use of anesthetics.  · Any blood disorders you have.  · Previous surgeries you have had.  · Medical conditions you have.  RISKS AND COMPLICATIONS   Generally, lung resection is a safe procedure. However, problems can occur and include:  · Excessive bleeding.  · Infection.  · Inability to breathe without a ventilator.  · Persistent shortness of breath.  · Heart problems, including abnormal rhythms and a risk of heart attack or heart failure.  · Blood clots.  · Injury to a blood vessel.  · Injury to a nerve.  · Failure to heal properly.  · Stroke.  · Bronchopleural fistula. This is a small hole between one of the main breathing tubes (bronchus) and the lining of the lungs. This is rare.  · Reaction to anesthesia.  BEFORE THE PROCEDURE   You may have tests done before the procedure, including:  · Blood tests.  · Urine tests.  · X-rays.  · Other imaging tests (such as CT scans, MRI scans, and PET scans). These tests are done to find the exact size and location of the condition being treated with this surgery.  · Pulmonary function tests. These are breathing tests to  assess the function of your lungs before surgery and to decide how to best help your breathing after surgery.  · Heart testing. This is done to make sure your heart is strong enough for the procedure.  · Bronchoscopy. This is a technique that allows your health care provider to look at the inside of your airways. This is done using a soft, flexible tube (bronchoscope). Along with imaging tests, this can help your health care provider know the exact location and size of the area that will be removed during surgery.  · Lymph node sampling. This may need to be done to see if the tumor has spread. It may be done as a separate surgery or right before your lung resection procedure.  PROCEDURE  · An IV tube will be placed in your arm. You will be given a medicine that makes you fall asleep (general anesthetic). You may also get pain medicine through a thin, flexible tube (catheter) in your back.  · A breathing tube will be placed in your throat.  · Once the surgical team has prepared you for surgery, your surgeon will make an incision on your side. Some resections are done through large incisions, while others can be done through small incisions using smaller instruments and assisted with small cameras (laparoscopic surgery).  · Your surgeon will carefully cut the veins, arteries, and bronchus leading to your lung. After being cut, each of these pieces will be sewn or stapled closed. The lung or part of the lung will then be removed.  · Your surgeon will check inside your chest to make sure there is no bleeding in or around the lungs. Lymph nodes near the lung may also be removed for later tests.  · Your surgeon may put tubes into your chest to drain extra fluid and air after surgery.  · Your incision will be closed. This may be done using:    Stitches that absorb into your body and do not need to be removed.    Stitches that must be removed.    Staples that must be removed.  AFTER THE PROCEDURE   · You will be taken to  the recovery area and your progress will be monitored. You may still have a breathing tube and other tubes or catheters in your body immediately after surgery. These will be removed during your recovery. You may be put on a respirator following surgery if some assistance is needed to help your breathing. When you are awake and not experiencing immediate problems from surgery, you will be moved to the intensive care unit (ICU) where you will continue your recovery.  · You may feel pain in your chest and throat. Sometimes during recovery, patients may shiver or feel nauseous. You will be given medicine to help with pain and nausea.  · The breathing tube will be taken out as soon as your health care providers feel you can breathe on your own. For most people, this happens on the same day as the surgery.  · If your surgery and time in the ICU go well, most of the tubes and equipment will be taken out within 1-2 days after surgery. This is about how long most people stay in the ICU. You may need to stay longer, depending on how you are doing.  · You should also start respiratory therapy in the ICU. This therapy uses breathing exercises to help your other lung stay healthy and get stronger.  · As you improve, you will be moved to a regular hospital room for continued respiratory therapy, help with your bladder and bowels, and to continue medicines.  · After your lung or part of your lung is taken out, there will be a space inside your chest. This space will often fill up with fluid over time. The amount of time this takes is different for each person.  · You will receive care until you are doing well and your health care provider feels it is safe for you to go home or to transfer to an extended care facility.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Non-small-cell lung cancer.    OPERATION PERFORMED:   1. Flexible bronchoscopy.  2. Right thoracotomy and right upper and middle bilobectomy.  3. Mediastinal lymph node dissection.    SURGEON: Krawczyk, MD    ASSISTANTS: Tarik Kuczynski, MD   Brady Ellias, MD    ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia.    ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 50 mL.    FLUIDS: 1 L normal saline.    INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: The patient is a 56-year-old female with multifocal lung cancer. She has 2 known lung cancers and 1 suspected lung cancer. She has a right upper lobe lung cancer x2, a possible right middle lobe lung cancer and possible left upper lobe lung cancer. She is status post previous cervical mediastinoscopy and a right video-assisted thoracoscopic right middle lobe wedge resection for a T1a N0 adenocarcinoma. She has had multiple multidisciplinary discussions regarding her care and has been undergoing targeted therapy for her lung cancers with a good response. She is thus taken to the operating room for surgical resection as part of a multimodality treatment plan.    DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: Following informed consent, the patient was brought into the operating room and placed in supine position. Flexible bronchoscopy was performed via a single-lumen endotracheal tube with systematic examination of the airways down to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally. There were no gross abnormalities noted. She then underwent single lung ventilation in preparation for thoracotomy. She was then placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and her right chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A right serratus-sparing posterolateral thoracotomy was performed, entering the chest within the 5th intercostal space. Upon entering the chest, there were no gross abnormalities noted. Her lung  otherwise appeared to be fairly healthy and the only abnormalities noted were staples in the vicinity of the right hilum and right middle lobe along the minor fissure where her prior surgery had been. We proceeded with right upper and middle lobectomy. The lung was reflected posteriorly, and the anterior mediastinal pleura was incised. The superior pulmonary vein was identified and isolated. This was divided using a vascular Endo-GIA staple load. The right middle lobe vein was also similarly identified and divided. Upon doing so, then the right middle lobe bronchus became readily visible. The right middle lobe bronchus was then divided at this point, demonstrating the right middle lobe artery. In doing so, the right middle lobe bronchus was readily visible. This was similarly dissected free and divided using a black load of the Endo-GIA stapler. We then turned our attention to dividing the truncus arteriosus using a vascular load of the Endo-GIA stapler, followed by division of the right middle lobe artery. At this point we completed the major fissure anteriorly and identified an accessory branch to the middle lobe artery, which was also divided using an endovascular stapler. Finally we identified a posterior ascending arterial branch of the pulmonary artery to the right upper lobe, which was similarly isolated and divided using an endovascular stapler. The remaining aspect of the fissure was divided using a purple load. At this point only the right upper lobe bronchus proper was remaining, and this was divided using a thick-tissue black staple load. Prior to completely transecting the right upper lobe bronchus, a test inflation was performed with good reinflation of the right lower lobe. Once this was done, the specimen was completely freed and passed off the field. We then performed a mediastinal lymph node dissection obtaining additional lymph nodes from level 11, level 4R superiorly, level 4R inferiorly, and  level 7. All specimens were sent off for final pathologic diagnosis. The chest was then irrigated copiously with clear return of fluid, and an underwater leak test was performed which was negative for any evidence of bronchial stump leak. A total of 2 chest tubes were then placed within the chest and brought out via separate stab incisions. They were secured using 0 silk suture at the skin. The lung was reinflated under direct visualization and the chest was closed in layers. The ribs were reapproximated using figure-of-eight pericostal sutures of #1 Vicryl followed by 0 Vicryl running suture for the serratus and latissimus muscles respectively, 2-0 Vicryl running deep dermal sutures, and 4-0 Monocryl at the skin. The patient tolerated the procedure well.    COMPLICATIONS: None.    DISPOSITION: Stable, extubated, and to Recovery.

As you know, Ms. Zei is a pleasant 57-year-old female with a past medical history of latent tuberculosis, status post 6 months of isoniazid 30 years ago with residual lung scar. She was diagnosed with multifocal lung adenocarcinoma and multiple EGFR mutation (right upper lobe mass EGFR exon 19 DL and right middle lobe tumor EGFR exon 21), and left upper lobe 2 cm nodule. She completed neoadjuvant Tarceva, followed by 4 cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed.     On 03/11/2025, PET-CT scan showed mild interval enlargement of right upper lobe mass reflecting mild progressive disease when compared to PET-CT performed on 11/13/2015. No new FDG avid nodule. No FDG avid lymphadenopathy. Grossly unchanged subsolid nodule on the left upper lobe. On 03/21/2016, she underwent a right thoracotomy, right upper and middle bilobectomy, mediastinal lymph  node dissection. She tolerated the procedure well without complication, discharged on postop day 5. Final pathology revealed upper lobe (periphery) adenocarcinoma. The tumor was 3.5 cm in size; 0/11 lymph nodes were negative for metastatic disease. It is a final stage T2a N0, stage IA non-small cell lung carcinoma. The 2nd site at the right upper lobe, along the main fissure middle, also adenocarcinoma, 1 cm in size. It is a final stage T1a N0, a separate stage IA non-small cell lung cancer.     She was last seen in our clinic on 04/01/2016, and recovering well, but endorsed moderate amount of drainage from chest tube site requiring frequent dressing changes. She also reported a \"bandlike\" feeling under the right breast, and a minor dry cough and nausea. She was taking oxycodone and tramadol with good pain relief, with no signs of infection near the chest tube site. We discussed with her that the drainage from the chest tube site should subside and we prescribed 3 days of Lasix for additional management. We also discussed that the \"bandlike\" feeling was most likely related to her postsurgical nerve inflammation and we encouraged her to continue the current regimen and it should resolve over time.     On today\\'s visit, Ms. Merced continues to be recovering well from her surgery. She endorses that the drainage from the chest tube site has subsided during her last visit. She continues with the nerve pain, but reports that it is improving. She continues taking oxycodone and tramadol with good pain relief. Her main complaint at today\\'s visit is an ongoing cough, reports usually throughout the day and subsides at night, mostly dry, but reports occasionally clear sputum production. Otherwise, she denies any fever, chills, chest pain, hemoptysis, constipation, diarrhea, decreased appetite, GI, or any neurological changes. She also reports shortness of breath with exertion, but reports that it is improving and she is  keeping active, going on long walks daily.    Physical Examination: Current vital signs: Blood pressure 111/68, pulse 102, respirations 21, temp 98.4, O2 saturation 99% on room air. Current weight 61.2 kg. Currently, she reports a 5/10 pain in her right upper chest area near the incision site. General appearance: Ms. Redd looks well, in no acute distress. Neck: Supple. No lymphadenopathy. Lungs: Clear to auscultation on the left. Right mid field to base absent breath sounds. No wheezing, rhonchi or rales noted. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1, S2. No rubs, murmurs, or gallops. Abdomen: Soft, nontender. No organomegaly. No masses palpable. Normal bowel sounds. Right thoracotomy incision healing well, with sutures over chest tube site intact, no drainage or erythema noted. Extremities: No edema, clubbing, cyanosis. Palpable pulses. Neuro: Alert and oriented x3. Skin: Warm, dry, and intact. Musculoskeletal/joints: Within normal limits. Neurologic: She is alert and appropriate. Clear speech. Moves all extremities with equal strength bilaterally.    Imaging: A 2 view chest x-ray showed interval resolution of right apical pneumothorax, with replacement by a small right apical loculated pleural effusion. No other acute cardiopulmonary findings noted.    Impression And Plan: Akila Merced is a 57-year-old female, status post right thoracotomy, right upper and middle bilobectomy, mediastinal lymph node dissection on 03/11/2016. Final pathology revealed right upper lobe (periphery) adenocarcinoma. The tumor was 3.5 cm in size; 0/11 lymph nodes were negative for metastatic disease. It is a T2a N0, stage IA non-small cell lung carcinoma. The 2nd site at the right upper lobe, along the main fissure middle also adenocarcinoma, 1 cm in size. It is a T1a N0, a separate stage IA non-small cell lung carcinoma. She continues to be recovering well from her surgery. There are no signs of infection noted along her incision  site, along with no further drainage from the chest tube site. She reports good pain relief with her current regimen of tramadol and oxycodone. Her main issue today is an ongoing cough. We have prescribed her guaifenesin with codeine p.r.n. to take to help with her cough. We encouraged her to continue her current activity, and did reinforce to her that what she is experiencing is all related to her surgery and should resolve over time. She is scheduled to follow up with Dr. Clowers in the radiation oncology clinic this week for SBRT to the left upper lobe. Ms.Merced will follow up with our clinic on the as-needed basis, and continue her followup care with Dr. Izaiah Grier in the thoracic oncology clinic, as well as Dr. Riel in the radiation oncology clinic. Ms. Merced and her husband had all their questions and concerns addressed at today\\'s visit and  agree with the plan.     Thank you for allowing us to help care for Ms. Roscoe Kolosky. Please feel free to contact our office with any questions or concerns.     Sincerely,        Ralph Koo, NP    I, Harrison Quick, MD, personally saw the patient and performed a substantive portion of this E/M visit face-to-face with the same patient on the same date of service with the Advanced Practice Provider (APP).

Escamilla, MD   Stanford Hospital     Sunitha Gubbala, MD   2410 Samaritan Dr Ste 853 I.5 Rd, Fruita CO     RE: Place, Muna   MRN: [000000]  DOB: 03/04/1959    Dear Colleagues,     We had the pleasure of seeing Trevor Draper in our thoracic surgery clinic at Millville  today for her 2nd postoperative visit.     As you know, Ms. Yamada is a pleasant 57-year-old female with a past medical history of latent tuberculosis, status post 6 months of isoniazid 30 years ago with residual lung scar. She was diagnosed with multifocal lung adenocarcinoma and multiple EGFR mutation (right upper lobe mass EGFR exon 19 DL and right middle lobe tumor EGFR exon 21), and left upper lobe 2 cm nodule. She completed neoadjuvant Tarceva, followed by 4 cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed.     On 03/11/2025, PET-CT scan showed mild interval enlargement of right upper lobe mass reflecting mild progressive disease when compared to PET-CT performed on 11/13/2015. No new FDG avid nodule. No FDG avid lymphadenopathy. Grossly unchanged subsolid nodule on the left upper lobe. On 03/21/2016, she underwent a right thoracotomy, right upper and middle bilobectomy, mediastinal lymph node dissection. She tolerated the procedure well without complication, discharged on postop day 5. Final pathology revealed upper lobe (periphery) adenocarcinoma. The tumor was 3.5 cm in size; 0/11 lymph nodes were negative for metastatic disease. It is a final stage T2a N0, stage IA non-small cell lung carcinoma. The 2nd site at the right upper lobe, along the main fissure middle, also adenocarcinoma, 1 cm in size. It is a final stage T1a N0, a separate stage IA non-small cell lung cancer.     She was last seen in our clinic on 04/01/2016,  and recovering well, but endorsed moderate amount of drainage from chest tube site requiring frequent dressing changes. She also reported a  \"bandlike\" feeling under the right breast, and a minor dry cough and nausea. She was taking oxycodone and tramadol with good pain relief, with no signs of infection near the chest tube site. We discussed with her that the drainage from the chest tube site should subside and we prescribed 3 days of Lasix for additional management. We also discussed that the \"bandlike\" feeling was most likely related to her postsurgical nerve inflammation and we encouraged her to continue the current regimen and it should resolve over time.     On today\\'s visit, Ms. Place continues to be recovering well from her surgery. She endorses that the drainage from the chest tube site has subsided during her last visit. She continues with the nerve pain, but reports that it is improving. She continues taking oxycodone and tramadol with good pain relief. Her main complaint at today\\'s visit is an ongoing cough, reports usually throughout the day and subsides at night, mostly dry, but reports occasionally clear sputum production. Otherwise, she denies any fever, chills, chest pain, hemoptysis, constipation, diarrhea, decreased appetite, GI, or any neurological changes. She also reports shortness of breath with exertion, but reports that it is improving and she is keeping active, going on long walks daily.    Physical Examination: Current vital signs: Blood pressure 111/68, pulse 102, respirations 21, temp 98.4, O2 saturation 99% on room air. Current weight 61.2 kg. Currently, she reports a 5/10 pain in her right upper chest area near the incision site. General appearance: Ms. Place looks well, in no acute distress. Neck: Supple. No lymphadenopathy. Lungs: Clear to auscultation on the left. Right mid field to base absent breath sounds. No wheezing, rhonchi or rales noted. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1, S2. No rubs, murmurs, or gallops. Abdomen: Soft, nontender. No organomegaly. No masses palpable. Normal bowel sounds. Right thoracotomy incision healing well, with sutures over chest tube site intact, no drainage or erythema noted. Extremities: No edema, clubbing, cyanosis. Palpable pulses. Neuro: Alert and oriented x3. Skin: Warm, dry, and intact. Musculoskeletal/joints: Within normal limits. Neurologic: She is alert and appropriate. Clear speech. Moves all extremities with equal strength bilaterally.    Imaging: A 2 view chest x-ray showed interval resolution of right apical pneumothorax, with replacement by a small right apical loculated pleural effusion. No other acute cardiopulmonary findings noted.    Impression And Plan: Trace Tobe is a 57-year-old female, status post right thoracotomy, right upper and middle bilobectomy, mediastinal lymph node dissection on 03/11/2016. Final pathology revealed right upper lobe (periphery) adenocarcinoma. The tumor was 3.5 cm in size; 0/11 lymph nodes were negative for metastatic disease. It is a T2a N0, stage IA non-small cell lung carcinoma. The 2nd site at the right upper lobe, along the main fissure middle also adenocarcinoma, 1 cm in size. It is a T1a N0, a separate stage IA non-small cell lung carcinoma. She continues to be recovering well from her surgery. There are no signs of infection noted along her incision site, along with no further drainage from the chest tube site. She reports good pain relief with her current regimen of tramadol and oxycodone. Her main issue today is an ongoing cough. We have prescribed her guaifenesin with codeine p.r.n. to take to help with her cough. We encouraged her to continue her current activity, and did reinforce to her that what she is experiencing is all related to her surgery and should resolve over time. She is scheduled to follow up with Dr. Quirk in the radiation oncology clinic this week for SBRT to the  left upper lobe. Ms.Place will follow up with our clinic on the as-needed basis, and  continue her followup care with Dr. Travis Aguirre in the thoracic oncology clinic, as well as Dr. Massey in the radiation oncology clinic. Ms. Place and her husband had all their questions and concerns addressed at today\\'s visit and  agree with the plan.      Thank you for allowing us to help care for Ms. Muna Place. Please feel free to contact our office with any questions or concerns.     Sincerely,      Rafael Arteaga, NP    I, Karl Chavez, MD, personally saw the patient and performed a substantive portion of this E/M visit face-to-face with the same patient on the same date of service with the Advanced Practice Provider (APP).

She recently had chemotherapy and then right upper and middle bilobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection for pT2aN0 and pT1aN0 adenocarcinomas of the right upper lobe. She is seen in followup for discussion of stereotactic radiation therapy to a left upper lobe ground-glass nodule likely representing a minimally invasive adenocarcinoma.    ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:   1. 2014: presented with chest pain. Chest CT 10/16/2014, showed a 4.8 cm right upper lobe opacity. Left upper lobe ground-glass opacity measured around 4 cm. Right lower lobe ground-glass lesion measured 2 cm.  2. CT-guided biopsy right upper lobe lesion on 02/11/2015, showed adenocarcinoma with exon 19 EGFR mutation. PET-CT showed SUV of 4.7 in this lesion. The left upper lobe lesion had SUV of 1.5.  3. 04/21/2015, mediastinoscopy and wedge resection of a right middle lobe lesion. Pathology demonstrated a 1.8 cm adenocarcinoma with negative margins. This tumor had exon 21 EGFR mutation. Left upper lobe lesion needle biopsy on 11/01/2015, was suspicious for a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.  4. Erlotinib starting in 04/21/2015.  5. She transferred her care to Stanford. PET-CT on 11/13/2015, showed new anterior mediastinal nodule, 1.1 cm, with SUV of 3.2, concerning for a nodal metastasis.  6. Due to the multifocal cancers with possible node involvement, she then received chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed x4 cycles.  7. 03/11/2016, PET-CT showed resolution of the anterior mediastinal node. Minimal change in the right apical and left upper lobe lung masses.  8. 03/21/2016, right thoracotomy, right upper and middle lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Eleven nodes were negative for malignancy. Two right upper lobe adenocarcinomas were  found measuring 3.5 and 1 cm. EGFR mutation testing has been ordered.    INTERVAL HISTORY: Ms Tomkins notes a cough since her April operation. She denies any fevers or chills. She has pain at the incision site. She has slowly been increasing her activity level. She plans to go back to work in June.    PHYSICAL EXAM: Deferred.    IMAGING: I reviewed her last few PET-CT and chest CT images. The fact that the anterior mediastinal nodule regressed so completely after chemotherapy while the primary lung cancers did not regress quickly may suggest that the mediastinal nodule was nonmalignant.    ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: I had seen Ms Tomkins in 10/22/2015 for consideration of stereotactic ablative radiation therapy to the left upper lobe presumed adenocarcinoma. Shortly after that she had a PET scan showing possible mediastinal node and plans for left upper lobe radiation were put on hold. After chemotherapy the mediastinal node resolved. It is not clear if this was involved with the cancer or was infectious/inflammatory. She has now had surgical removal of two primary lung cancers in the right lung. The tumor board recommendation is for stereotactic ablative radiation therapy to the left upper lobe likely adenocarcinoma. The mediastinum will be closely followed with imaging.    I will plan to treat the left upper lobe lung cancer with 4 days of stereotactic radiation. She is still healing from surgery so I will wait 2 weeks before performing a radiation planning scan and then will give the treatment starting 2 weeks after that. I went over potential acute and late toxicities with the patient, including chest wall pain or rib fracture, radiation pneumonitis which could be life-threatening, and a very small risk of damage to the aorta.     Ms Tomkins would like to proceed with radiation therapy. She signed a consent form. We will perform simulation the week of 04/22/2025. First surveillance imaging after treatment will likely be  with a PET-CT 2-3 months after completion of radiation therapy.

Patient with frequent uncontrolled coughing throughout the conversation.  Reports she started taking codeine cough syrup after last visit with Dr. Linehan on 5/2, but stopped because of nausea.  Reports feeling like she was getting sick on Friday, followed by a weekend of nausea and vomiting.  Went to PCP on Monday, 5/9 who sent her to ER at Good Samaritan for IV hydration where she received 2L NS, nausea medication and dilaudid for pain.  Patient reports she is doing better now, but has more pain in the right breast area.  RN stated this was likely due to an irritation of the surgical site from repeated wretching.  Recommended that patient try codeine cough syrup again as this was not likely the cause of her weekend of vomiting.  Recommended to take with bland food such as toast or banana.  Patient agreed.  Also stated she would try to get back on her previously successful regimen on tramadol and tessalon perles.  RN advised she take it easy and contact the thoracic team if her pain or cough did not improve.

Now with multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with multiple EGFR mutations (RUL mass- EGFR exon 19 del and RML tumor- EGFR exon 21). S/p first line tarceva. Followed by 4 cycles carboplatin and pemetrexed. Here for follow up after recent bilobectomy.    Oncologic History/History of Present Illness: (adapted from prior records)  Summer 2014: Atypical chest pain   11/14: CT scan showed RUL scarring/nodule. Recommended to be followed with serial CTs.  2/15: CT scan did not show significant change but recommended to proceed with biopsy.   02/21/2015: CT guided RUL biopsy showed adenocarcinoma with EGFR exon 19 deletion.  Brain MRI negative for metastases.   03/08/2015: PET-CT scan revealed 3 focal lesions (RUL, RML, LUL).   4/15: CT guided biopsy of LUL showed suspicious cells. (unable to rule out carcinoma)  5/15: Mediastinoscopy negative lymph nodes.   She undergoes attempted resection in Ellsworth  with a partial right middle lobe resection. Ultimately, the surgeon aborts the procedure for unclear reasons at the time. The intention was to do a right middle lobe resection, right upper lobectomy, and to at a later date do a wedge on the left upper lobe suspicious lesion. Pathology on the right middle lobe partial wedge resection demonstrated a separate exon 21 EGFR mutation.   04/28/2015: Started erlotinib 150 mg daily  6/15: Erlotinib dose reduced to 100 mg daily due to skin side effects.  7/15: surveillance chest imaging showed stable disease.   09/06/2015: CT scan- slight decreased opacity in right lung apex, otherwise stable  09/09/2015: Brain MRI- negative for metastases  10/05/2015: initial consult with stanford thoracic oncology  11/15:  reviewed case at tumor board. Consensus for surgical resection of RUL and RML and SABR to LUL lung nodule.   11/14/2015: PET CT- Interval improvement in the RUL mass and opacity at the level of the hilum. New 0.9 x 1.1 cm anterior mediastinal nodule SUV 3.2. Surgery canceled.   11/28/2015: C1 carbo AUC 5, alimta 500 mg/m2  12/21/2015: C2 carbo AUC 5, alimta 500 mg/m2  01/09/2016: CT CAP: improved anterior mediastinal LN, stable lung masses  01/12/2016: C3 carbo, alimta  02/02/2016: C4 carbo, alimta  02/20/2016: CT CAP: stable disease  03/21/2016: Right thoracotomy and right upper and middle bilobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection: two foci of invasive adenoracinoma: (1) moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma, 3.5 cm; (2) well-differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma, 1cm; 0/11 lymph nodes positive, bone and soft tissue biopsy of 6th rib negative.  05/07/2016: planned to start XRT to LUL nodules    Interval History/Review of Systems  Ms. Spencer reports difficult time since surgery, still with postsurgical pain at thoracotomy site and anteriorly.  Reports limited range of motion and still having to sleep on her back.  Taking tramadol with reasonable control.  Pain exacerbated by coughing.  Using tessalon perles with moderate effect.  Feels that post-op cough is somewhat improved.  She had GI bug two weekends ago with vomiting which exacerbated pain and was seen in local ED for hydration and antiemetics.  She had planning imaging for radiation today and is planned to start in 2 weeks.    Wants to check in about plan going forward today.      Here with her supportive husband.     A full 14-point review of systems was performed today. The relevant details are described above with other systems negative.

Consensus of thoracic tumor board to proceed with surgical resection of the RUL and RML and SABR to the left lung lesion. Recent PET CT showed a new anterior mediastinal node with decrease in the RUL lesions. After review at the tumor board, consensus was to proceed with systemic chemotherapy to allow for more systemic control before proceeding with surgical resection of the right lung lesions and SABR to the LUL lesion. Imaging after 4 cycles of therapy showed response/resolution of anterior mediastinal lymph node.    Since her last visit, she has completed her right upper and middle bilobectomy with Dr. Tatara which showed two foci of invasive carcinoma and 0/11 lymph nodes involved.  She has had significant pain post-op which has been complicated by cough and vomiting with GI bug.  Pain is reasonably  controlled and we discussed that pain and cough should continue to improve.  She is planned to start XRT in 2 weeks with the hope that cough is improved at that time.  We agree with this plan and would recommend follow up with imaging 3 months after completion of radiation.  We are happy to see her sooner if she is still having a difficult time.      Plan:  #multiple EGFR mutations (RUL- exon 19 deletion and RML exon 21) with 3 separate primary adenocarcinomas (RUL, RML, and LUL)  -PET CT with new anterior mediastinal nodule, which decreased with chemotherapy  -s/p cycle 4 carboplatin AUC 5 and pemetrexed 500mg/m2.   -s/p RUL and RML bilobectomy with Dr. Caro on 4/14  - plan for SABR to LUL on 05/07/2016    #cough  -tessalon perles  -intolerance to codeine  -discussed option of hydrocodone if needed    #post-surgical pain  -continue tramadol    #social  -recommend continued disability/time off until at least 2 weeks after completion of radiation.  -will write letter she must be off work until 6/20, but will continue to evaluate as needed.    RTC late August/early September with scans post-radiation    As usual, we encouraged the patient to contact us sooner should she develop any new/worsening symptoms or have any questions or concerns.    The patient was seen concurrently with Dr. Kenyon Millward, attending physician, who agreed with the above assessment and plan.    Signed, 04/22/2016  Telford, MSN, RN, ANP-BC, AOCNP  Nurse Practitioner  Thoracic Oncology  Stanford Cancer Center   Pager: 17182    I, Draper, MD, performed a substantive portion of an E/M visit face-to-face with the same patient on the same date of service with the Advanced Practice Provider (APP).   I was personally involved in reviewing and conducting elements of the history, physical exam and/or medical decision making including the information as described below:  Ms. Spencer is recovering well from her surgery, but still  with pain and cough. We discussed her cough regimen. She is recovering. She is very happy to have proceeded with the surgery.  Is scheduled for radiation and will need some additional time off before she is ready for work with her ongoing pain and cough.  Await the molecular results.
